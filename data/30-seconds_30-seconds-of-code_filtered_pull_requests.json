When you use `takeWhile()`, what you really say is: out of these array elements `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, take (keep selecting) elements while an element (`n`) is less than 3.  Earlier example `takeWhile([1, 2, 3, 4], n => n >= 3);` was less intuitive as you are asking for elements greater than equal to 3 but actually expect `[1, 2]` in t=return.",

For example, it would be much cleaner to say `lightness * 0.5` to make it darker than doing `l * 0.5` etc. PS I also vote we do this to [`toRGBObject`](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/js/s/to-rgb-object).\r\n\r\nAnyways to celebrate 2000 followers on our Twitter bot we made a year ago, I got this Greek candy: \r\n\r\n\r\n![IMG_7872](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25749162/96296321-6588da00-0fef-11eb-9664-20115c1f982c.jpg)\r\n",

Then the smaller array is iterated on with a lookup search on the hashMap object.\r\n\r\nThe worst case complexity of the new algorithm is O(n).\r\n\r\n[isContainedInOld vs isContainedInNew](https://perf.link/#eyJpZCI6IjA3dm01NWRnemtnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJGaW5kaW5nIG51bWJlcnMgaW4gYW4gYXJyYXkgb2YgMTAwMCIsImJlZm9yZSI6ImNvbnN0IGRlbW8xID0gWy4uLkFycmF5KDEwMDApLmtleXMoKV07XG5jb25zdCBkZW1vMiA9IFsuLi5BcnJheSg5MDApLmtleXMoKV07XG5cbmNvbnN0IGlzQ29udGFpbmVkSW5PbGQgPSAoYSwgYikgPT4ge1xuICBmb3IgKGNvbnN0IHYgb2YgbmV3IFNldChhKSkge1xuICAgIGlmICghYi5zb21lKGUgPT4gZSA9PT0gdikgfHwgYS5maWx0ZXIoZSA9PiBlID09PSB2KS5sZW5ndGggPiBiLmZpbHRlcihlID0%2BIGUgPT09IHYpLmxlbmd0aClcbiAgICAgIHJldHVybiBmYWxzZTtcbiAgfVxuICByZXR1cm4gdHJ1ZTtcbn07XG5cbmNvbnN0IGlzQ29udGFpbmVkSW5OZXcgPSAoYSwgYikgPT4ge1xuICBpZiAoYS5sZW5ndGggIT09IFsuLi5uZXcgU2V0KGEpXS5sZW5ndGgpIHtcbiAgICByZXR1cm4gZmFsc2U7XG4gIH1cblxuICBjb25zdCBoYXNoTWFwID0ge307XG4gIFxuICBiLmZvckVhY2goKGl0ZW0sIGluZGV4KSA9PiBoYXNoTWFwW2l0ZW1dID0gaW5kZXgpO1xuICBcbiAgcmV0dXJuIGEuZXZlcnkoKGl0ZW0pID0%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)\r\n\r\nI also updated the documentation and added new example cases.\r\n",
