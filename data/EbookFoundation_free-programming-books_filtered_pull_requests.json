Most approaches cause some degree of pain, but you can follow Pain Driven Development to refactor to different approaches. In this code-heavy approach, you'll see how an app starts with a low-level tightly-coupled data access approach and iteratively evolves to address the pain points encountered. By the end of the session, the app's data access will be encapsulated and modular and the app will be testable and maintainable. And you'll have learned a variety of design patterns and refactoring techniques that you can apply to your own applications. Demos and samples will use C#/.NET, but principles and patterns are applicable to other platforms and languages.\r\n\r\n### Why is this valuable (or not)?\r\nIt is not yet available in the repository and is a nice addition to the screencast section.\r\n\r\n### How do we know it's really free?\r\nIt's a free youtube video\r\n\r\n### For book lists, is it a book?

This new edition comes with Gradiance, an online assessment tool developed for computer science.\r\n### Why is this valuable (or not)?\r\nWith its innovative underlying technology, Gradiance turns basic homework assignments and programming labs into an interactive learning experience for students. By using a series of \"root questions\" and hints, it not only tests a student's capability, but actually simulates a one-on-one teacher-student tutorial that allows for the student to more easily learn the material. Through the programming labs, instructors are capable of testing, tracking and honing their students' skills, both in terms of syntax and semantics, with an unprecedented level of assessment never before offered.\r\n\r\n### How do we know it's really free?\r\nIt is available free of cost on Internet archive.\r\n### For book lists, is it a book?

They can extract, inline, replace, move, rename, etc. at will. The widespread availability of automated refactoring should have made oversized classes and long-winded functions a thing of the past. But it hasn't.\r\n\r\nHaving a tool is only part of the solution: knowing what to do with it and how to use it well is what makes the bigger difference. In this talk, we'll revisit what refactoring is (and isn't), examine what practical and social obstacles refactoring faces, explore the idea that refactoring should be considered a design process and not just a clean-up click, and that most interesting refactorings are not necessarily automated.\r\n\r\n### Why is this valuable (or not)?\r\nScreencast is not existant in the ebooks repository.\r\n\r\n### How do we know it's really free?\r\nIt's a video on youtube\r\n\r\n### For book lists, is it a book?

They can extract, inline, replace, move, rename, etc. at will. The widespread availability of automated refactoring should have made oversized classes and long-winded functions a thing of the past. But it hasn't.\r\n\r\nHaving a tool is only part of the solution: knowing what to do with it and how to use it well is what makes the bigger difference. In this talk, we'll revisit what refactoring is (and isn't), examine what practical and social obstacles refactoring faces, explore the idea that refactoring should be considered a design process and not just a clean-up click, and that most interesting refactorings are not necessarily automated.\r\n\r\n### Why is this valuable (or not)?\r\nCourse is not existant in the ebooks repository.\r\n\r\n### How do we know it's really free?\r\nIt's a video on youtube\r\n\r\n### For book lists, is it a book?
