When a match is found then it should be used and no further matching should occur. \r\n\r\nRight now, the current setup works in TypeScript but it's considered a bug and it should not be relied upon, see the thread and the comment [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/50762#issuecomment-1528318260). For that reason, I would like to fix all popular packages that misconfigured their `exports` this way so the bug can be fixed in TypeScript.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f this PR focuses solely on fixing \"\ud83d\udc1b Used fallback condition\" problem but the \"\ud83c\udfad Masquerading as CJS\" remains here (and \"\ud83d\udc80 Failed to resolve\" for some entries).

This is because [inside Picnic CSS' package.json](https://github.com/franciscop/picnic/blob/master/package.json#L11) I have set this property:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n \"main\": \"picnic.min.css\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I am proposing to add the same property for Font-Awesome to be able to import Font-Awesome with just this code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport 'picnic';\r\nimport 'font-awesome';\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will make it really intuitive for React devs to install and use Font-Awesome without having to dig into the code/repository to find out where the actual package is located.",

        "body": "- Moving the resources from CDNJs to JSDelivr. In HTTP/2 and SPDY it is recommended to host all dependencies in the same CDN or web server, so all resources are downloaded using the same HTTP connection. It's faster than establish a connection to two CDN providers. In the past using multiple CDN was the best option, but no longer. So we have to put them in just one CDN, I don't have any relation with JSDelivr but think is the best available option.\n- Added SRI (integrity) to external scripts. This prevents an infection if the CDN is compromised.\n- I removed version aliasing from Algolia (3) and put specific version (3.13.1). This way the cache TTL is longer and avoid breaking changes if the library is updated.\n- I added the JSDelivr RUM script. This allow them to test the performance of downloading scripts and takes better load balancing decision for the CDN resources.\n",

As per [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#key-branches), it's compared against master as there's only a change to the documentation.\n\nThe change makes a small (but I think important) distinction: not all low vision users browse using high contrast mode, but all low vision users benefit from a proper contrast ratio. I think if it's phrased in terms of how it applies to the app in a normal viewing context, developers less familiar with accessibility considerations will be (hopefully) less likely to dismiss it as an edge case.\n\nI've also linked to a easy to use color contrast checker tool which has more information about WCAG color contrast criteria.\n",

You can check here:\n[http://mr21.github.io/_/fa/test-pseudo-elements/**after**.html](http://mr21.github.io/_/fa/test-pseudo-elements/after.html).\n\nI add a `:before` behind every CSS rules **except** after: `.fa-ul { ... }` and `.fa-ul > li { ... }`\n\nPS: I firstly pushed only the `css/font-awesome.css`.\n",

        "body": "Hello Dave, hello Geremia,\n\nAs you might know, the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) community is widely using Font-Awesome. We had many different wrapper packages all doing the same thing, so I'm submitting a PR that integrates Meteor packaging directly into your repository: at the end of this merge process, in case you'll find yourself comfortable with it, we'll get automated new meteor package releases at every new release of Font-Awesome.\n\nAll you have to do after accepting this PR would be:\n1. create an account at https://meteor.com/ (click SIGN IN, then Create account). After you've done that, please let me know the name of the account, and we'll add you as a maintainer of the `fortawesome` organization (which has been alredy reserved to make things simpler for you).\n2. head to [autopublish.meteor.com](http://autopublish.meteor.com/) sign in with your gitHub account, locate this repository and enable it for autopublish by toggling the checkbox you'll find on the right side of the repository item. You can get an idea about how Meteor Autopublish works by having a quick look at [this page](http://autopublish.meteor.com/howitworks), but basically it creates a [web hook](https://help.github.com/articles/about-webhooks/) to let us know when you push new tags. And when you'll release new versions, autopublish.meteor.com will automatically take delivery for publishing the new version also for Meteor!\n\nPlease note that you will not be able to toggle your repository until you'll have the `package.js` file on your master branch.\n\nPlease also note that we've already published the current version of the package on [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/fortawesome/fontawesome) (Meteor's package directory) under the name `fortawesome:fontawesome`. \nBut if you think another name would be a better fit, just let us know!\n\nThanks & best regards,\nLuca & the [Meteor integrations team](https://github.com/raix/Meteor-community-discussions/issues/14)\n",
