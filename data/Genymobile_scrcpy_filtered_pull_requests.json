In addition, if the window is already open, it will be brought to foregroud (unless it is minimized). This wont quite work yet, as the window title is dependent on the device. Maybe one could get this name dynamically or rename the window to scrcpy on all devices. just a suggestion",

        "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nHopefully I've done everything right despite knowing next to nothing about C or Java.\r\n\r\nThe PR addresses mostly Polish language (which uses chars like \"\u017c/\u017b\", \"\u0105/\u0104\", \"\u0119/\u0118\"), but I have included every available character in Windows' charmap which had either \"dot above\" or \"ogonek\", respectively (the terminology came from charmap, but \"ogonek\" literally means \"a little tail\" and is actually used by the Polish people to describe those two letters).\r\n\r\nIn the class I interjected the `dotabove` above umlaut since I was trying to preserve the UTF order. Below, in private static and mapping itself, I just added it to the end, so the grouping would hopefully make sense.\r\n\r\nThere is a nonsensical sentence `ZA\u017b\u00d3\u0141\u0106 G\u0118\u015aL\u0104 JA\u0179\u0143` used to test if a keyboard layout, a program, etc. can display all Polish diacritics. Right now, it ends up as `ZA\u00d3\u0106 G\u015aL JA\u0179\u0143`. After this PR is merged, it _should_ be almost correct - `ZA\u017b\u00d3\u0106 G\u0118\u015aL\u0104 JA\u0179\u0143`, missing only the `\u0141` character. Sadly, `\u0141` itself is _impossible_ to decompose because of no UTF chars exist for \"connecting upwards stroke\", so \"\u0142/\u0141\" seems to be out of reach until this gets added (which it probably won't). I know \"connecting short stroke\" and \"connecting long stroke\" exist, but even if they did work (because I was not able to make them work properly), it would still be a different character (`L` + `-` != `\u0141`).\r\n\r\nSince there is addition, but no change or removal of anything, this should merge nicely.",

        "body": "Last month, @yume-chan [submitted](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/3703) a working PoC to capture audio on Android. Big thanks for this discovery!\r\n\r\nSince then I have worked to properly integrate audio support in scrcpy (capture, encode, transmit, record, decode, resample, play\u2026), and my branch reached a working state (at least on my machine) :tada:\r\n\r\nBy default, audio is enabled (if supported):\r\n - On Android >= 12, it works out-of-the-box;\r\n - On Android 11, the device screen must be unlocked (because of a dirty workaround to make the system think the app is foreground, again thank you to @yume-chan for the tip);\r\n - On Android <= 10, it does not work, audio is automatically disabled.\r\n \r\nIf audio capture fails, then mirroring continues with video only (since audio is enabled by default, it is not acceptable to make scrcpy fail if audio is not available), unless `--require-audio` is set.\r\n \r\nTo disable audio:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscrcpy --no-audio\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf audio is enabled, it is also recorded when recording is enabled:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscrcpy --record=file.mp4\r\nscrcpy --record=file.mkv\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo play audio in real-time, the audio player implements drift compensation (it attempts to keep audio sample buffering to a certain level, quite low to get low-latency, but not too low to avoid underflow). It is experimental ~(I just tinkered with this thing today)~ (I've made a lot of improvements since the initial MR, and it should work pretty fine), parameters and behavior are hardcoded, some configuration variables might need to be exposed in the future (or not).\r\n\r\nIf you record, the timestamps are computed on the device, so they are not impacted by any jitter/underflow (this is the same as for the video), so the recording is always clean (if you use `--record` of course, not if you capture your audio output on the computer).\r\n\r\nLike the video, it works over TCP/IP (typically Wifi).\r\n\r\nThe following options have been renamed:\r\n\r\n - `--codec` -> `--video-codec`\r\n - `--bit-rate` -> `--video-bitrate`\r\n - `--codec-options` -> `--video-codec-options`\r\n - `--encoder` -> `--video-encoder`\r\n \r\nAnd similar options for audio have been added:\r\n - `--audio-codec`\r\n - `--audio-bit-rate`\r\n - `--audio-codec-options`\r\n - `--audio-encoder`\r\n\r\nThree audio formats are supported:\r\n - [Opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)): `scrcpy --audio-codec=opus`\r\n - [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding): `scrcpy --audio-codece=aac`\r\n - Raw (uncompressed) PCM 16-bit LE: `scrcpy --audio-codec=raw` (more bandwidth, typically just for testing)\r\n \r\nIt is possible to list the encoders available on the device (video and audio):\r\n\r\n```\r\nscrcpy --list-encoders\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need a specific encoder, use `--audio-encoder`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscrcpy --audio-codec=aac --audio-encoder='OMX.google.aac.encoder'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen recording, raw audio is not possible (it automatically switches to OPUS). In the future, I might add audio encoding on the client-side specifically for recording, but I don't plan to make it for this audio feature.\r\n\r\nI also implemented `--audio-buffer=` similar to existing `--display-buffer=` and `--v4l2-buffer=`.\r\n\r\nThis branch is in working state.\r\n\r\nSince I have refactored A LOT of code, I may have broken things (please tell me!).\r\n\r\nPlease test, review (good luck, that's a big PR :wink:), and report any problem :)\r\n\r\nFixes #14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details><summary>old</summary>\r\n\r\nHere is a release build for the current MR for Windows (`audio.115`):\r\n\r\n- [`scrcpy-win64-PR3757-1.zip`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/3757/1/scrcpy-win64-PR3757-1.zip) <sub>`SHA-256: 8a46774889f0d6602e7f94c1e664b7184fdc0f0ccfe4d114045d2a8eefb408f6`</sub>\r\n- [`scrcpy-win32-PR3757-1.zip`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/3757/1/scrcpy-win32-PR3757-1.zip) <sub>`SHA-256: 7b07819377fa87f1a94f5a424b6757590492b32309d59457fb4eb1e543902bd4`</sub>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nHere is a release build for the current MR for Windows (`audio.145`):\r\n\r\n- [`scrcpy-win64-PR3757-3.zip`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/3757/3/scrcpy-win64-PR3757-3.zip) <sub>`SHA-256: 6ef3c45292f5c3b713628e593bbf695be586506cd38a26f038d135cd88d08033`</sub>\r\n- [`scrcpy-win32-PR3757-3.zip`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/3757/3/scrcpy-win32-PR3757-3.zip) <sub>`SHA-256: 06fc50e289494554aa1d86a783960b5fd42268ac18395f224b0ea355aa377dd5`</sub>",

It is adapted from [`vlc_vector`](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/blob/0857947abaed9c89810cd96353aaa1b7e6ba3b0d/include/vlc_vector.h) that I initially [wrote while implementing the VLC playlist](https://blog.rom1v.com/2019/05/a-new-core-playlist-for-vlc-4).\r\n\r\nIt is then used for listing usb devices and adb devices to remove any hardcoded limitation (the vector grows dynamically as necessary).\r\n\r\nThere is still a limitation in the parsing of `adb devices -l`, which is implemented for simplicity in a single pass on the whole output. The output was limited to 4096 bytes (which represents ~40 devices). I changed to 65536 bytes, it should be sufficient in practice (~650 devices listed by `adb devices` should never happen).\r\n\r\nThis replaces #3029.\r\n\r\n@DarkZeros I added you as co-author for the adb devices listing. Please test this PR and confirm that it works for your use case.",

It was based on HID keyboard introduced in [v1.20](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/tag/v1.20) and HID mouse also introduced in v1.22. It was only supported on Linux.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, it is not possible to open a USB device if it is already open by another process (like the adb daemon). As a consequence, we can't send HID events if adb is running. Therefore, on Windows, `--hid-keyboard` and `--hid-mouse` while mirroring are not possible. These features are still limited to Linux.\r\n\r\nHowever, in OTG mode (`--otg`), no adb is necessary, so it is possible to open the USB device to send HID events. This PR adds support for `--otg` on Windows.\r\n\r\nConcretely:\r\n - download the unofficial release below\r\n - extract it\r\n - double-click on `open_a_terminal_here.bat` (extracted from the release)\r\n - plug an Android device over USB\r\n - execute `scrcpy --otg`\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/2773\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is an unofficial release with this branch, so that you can test and report issues:\r\n - [`scrcpy-otg-windows-win64.zip`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/3011/1/scrcpy-win64-otg-windows.zip) _sha256:6cb1a9e01441fedb9618fa98b8403aecbed39bc7167e8edd3f44fb6227591b8d_\r\n - ~[`scrcpy-otg-windows-win32.zip`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/3011/1/scrcpy-win32-otg-windows.zip) _sha256:38a397086999c51ff8634915dd3c1f0792587aeccdd6a65961a841a9e5d87db3_~\r\n\r\nNote that on my test computer with Windows 10 64bit, the win32 version does not work due to missing `libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll`.\r\nAccording to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12921911/mingw-libgcc-s-sjlj-1-dll-is-missing), a linker flag `-static-libgcc` must be added somewhere, but I think it is related to prebuilt libusb dll for win32 (since it works for win64).\r\n\r\nEDIT: yes, it's a problem on the libusb prebuilt dll for win32: https://github.com/libusb/libusb/issues/1049",

        "body": "... and used by another process.\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nDo not rush to merge this PR. At this point I'm more interested in your feedback and ideas how to improve my code.\r\n\r\nMy intent is to integrate scrcpy with SikuliX library to enable testing and automation of Android phones. https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1 https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/issues/473\r\n\r\nTo do that, I am attempting to modify scrcpy to be a shared library that can be invoked. Since SikuliX is in Java, I'm using https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/ for integration. I needed to make following changes to scrcpy:\r\n\r\n* Modify mezon build to create a shared library\r\n* Split up \"scrcpy\" function into \"start\", \"event loop\" and \"stop\" functions. External process can call \"start\" and \"stop\" functions at will and thus control the lifecycle. I think this approach is quite clean and non-disruptive and could be merged upstream.\r\n* Added structs to support the split (a bit ugly at the moment) and added a function to hook into the video frame decoder.\r\n\r\nThese changes are sufficient for me to get a video feed inside Java process and copy frames into a BufferedImage. I can provide Java code tomorrow if you are interested- it needs a bit of cleaning up before I can make it public.\r\n\r\nMy question is if you would consider accepting changes like this upstream and merging them. It is my honest belief that  adding better ability to integrate it with other software would boost scrcpy's popularity and usefulness.\r\n\r\nNext steps- I intend to add ability to send events (mouse clicks, key presses, etc.) to Android next. If you have any comments on how to improve the changes I have made, please let me know and I'll do my best to accommodate you.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm doing this as a hobby, not a commercial project.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nTeofilis Martisius",

So I make this PR to make sure at least we can use the latest 64bit FFmpeg.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are two semi-official providers of binary pre-compiled builds for windows, [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) and [BtbN](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds). \r\n\r\nThe reason why I chose the former is that for the stable version of FFmpeg, he only provides a single compiled version, so it is more stable and controllable; Another one often publishes updated pre-compiled files of the stable version.",

        "body": "To minimize latency, scrcpy always displays a frame as soon as it is available, without waiting. This design decision is (on purpose) at the cost of jitter: the delay between frames is not preserved.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, every frame produced by the device would be displayed some constant time later on the device (for simplicity, the schema assumes a constant framerate):\r\n\r\n![nojitter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/124643682-a5e7fb00-de91-11eb-9101-874a34124b2f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, in reality, the delay is not constant; the encoding time, transfer time and decoding time may vary from frame to frame:\r\n\r\n![jitter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/124643679-a5e7fb00-de91-11eb-9663-9c4f9ff65c11.png)\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is not a problem for many real-time use cases. It is slightly noticeable when playing a video on the device (or anything involving regular movement) while mirroring.\r\n\r\nOn recording (`--record`), scrcpy captures the timestamps on the device and write them in the resulting file, so that the playback is correct without jitter.\r\n\r\nHowever, some real-time use cases may benefit from adding a small latency to compensate for jitter too. For example, few tens of milliseconds of latency for live-streaming are not important, but jitter is noticeable.\r\n\r\nTo support this, the principle is to delay the frames to compensate for jitter (notice how the blue circles have the same spacing as the green circles):\r\n\r\n![buffering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/124643677-a54f6480-de91-11eb-9152-dc76d6e54e60.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR implements optional buffering:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscrcpy --display-buffer=50  # add 50 ms buffering for display\r\nscrcpy --v4l2-buffer=500    # add 500 ms buffering for v4l2 sink\r\n```\r\n\r\nDisplay buffering and [v4l2](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#v4l2loopback) are independent, so that it is possible for example to control it with minimal delay but stream it with a larger delay.\r\n\r\nIn practice, here is a graph showing the difference in smoothness (after a small initialization phase) with a buffer of 50ms on a wireless connection:\r\n\r\n![capture_graph3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/125527579-dc506790-51c5-4af2-a87e-41fd86b5a280.png)\r\n([graph_old_impl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/124667050-29641500-deaf-11eb-8796-6e2403c2bceb.png))\r\n\r\nFixes #2417\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is a binary of the current `dev` branch (`f78608ab298b1a9cd17e11e0b1219da9f6b5b88e`), including this feature.\r\n\r\nFor windows users, take both `scrcpy.exe` and `scrcpy-server`, and replace them in your scrcpy v1.18 release.\r\n\r\nFor other platforms, take `scrcpy-server` and [build](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md#option-2-use-prebuilt-server) only the client.\r\n\r\n - [`scrcpy.exe`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/2464/1/scrcpy.exe)\r\n  _SHA256: 304147bdce3a521a7dd7db5833f9e49e51646d09b0596657a0e52a005857c584_\r\n - [`scrcpy-server`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/2464/1/scrcpy-server)\r\n  _SHA256: 641c5c6beda9399dfae72d116f5ff43b5ed1059d871c9ebc3f47610fd33c51a3_",

        "body": "This is a follow up for v4l2loopback support (#2232 #2233) implemented by @martinellimarco.\r\n\r\nI refactored scrcpy to support this feature properly, then I rebased @martinellimarco's work to use the refactored codebase.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose is to make the v4l2 component consume frames directly from the decoder, in order to avoid decoding the video stream twice if mirroring display is enabled:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                      screen/display\r\n                    /\r\n            decoder\r\n          /         \\\r\n         /            v4l2_sink\r\n  stream\r\n         \\\r\n           recorder\r\n\r\n          \\--------/  \\-------------/\r\n         packet sinks   frame sinks\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the changes:\r\n - Remove `--render-expired-frames` option (see 8bae1f6b7fc7a82ea2d04c76e21fd127617c97d6 for details)\r\n - Remove compat with old FFmpeg decodeing and codec params API (deprecated since 2016)\r\n - Make video_buffer not consume the input frame (to make possible to send it to several sinks)\r\n - Add two abstractions (traits):\r\n   - `sc_packet_sink`: a component which receives packets. It is implemented by the `decoder` and the `recorder`, and the `stream` now push its packets to the registered packet sinks (without depending on the concrete sink types)\r\n   - `sc_frame_sink`: a component which receives frames. It is implemented by the `screen` (and now `v4l2`), and the `decoder` now pushes its frames to the registered frame sinks (without depending on the concrete sink types)\r\n - Add a new mode for `--lock-video-orientation`: `initial`. This locks the video in the orientation the device happens to be on start and avoids to pass an explicit value. This mode is set by default when v4l2 sink is enabled.\r\n - Rework the v4l2 sink component to implement `sc_frame_sink`, and be registered to the `decoder`.\r\n - Use a `video_buffer` to always send the very last frame, like for the display (it may skip frames, it's on purpose, is it a problem?)\r\n - Add some documentation in the README\r\n\r\nHere is a usage summary:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt install v4l2loopback-dkms   # install v4l2loopback\r\nsudo modprobe v4l2loopback           # create a video device\r\nscrcpy --v4l2-sink /dev/video1       # mirror + v4l2\r\nscrcpy --v4l2-sink /dev/video1 -N    # v4l2 only\r\nffplay -i /dev/video1                # test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe video stream could also be captured from [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).\r\n\r\nThank you for your reviews/feedbacks.",

In this case, they are assigned based on my perceived difficulty in activating the feature using the mouse and how often used.\r\n\r\nGiven such, I decided that app switch to be the 4th button and notifications panel to be the 5th button.\r\nThese are what I believe to be the best use for these two. The 4th button being the app switch should be close to the no-brainer.\r\nAs for the notifications being the 5th, that one is more open for discussion. IMO, the major competitors being:\r\n\r\n1. Notifications panel\r\n2. Pinch-to-zoom\r\n3. paste\r\n\r\nNo more buttons are assigned because SDL doesn't support them. \r\nFor now, I would present this way, as a way to start a discussion",

        "body": "This request is to open a discussion about support for v4l2loopback that will also allows to support OBS on linux, as many have requested.\r\n\r\nThe code is working and it was tested with a few different phones and computers but other tests are more than welcome.\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\nTo test it first you'll need to `modprobe v4l2loopback`, then run `scrcpy --v4l2sink /dev/video0 -N` and open the loopback with some other program like VLC, ffplay or OBS (tested all 3 of them).\r\n\r\nThe video stream can be simultaneously seen in scrcpy window, recorded with `--record` and sinked to v4l2loopback with `--v4l2sink`.\r\n\r\nIt has not been tested without SCRCPY_LAVF_HAS_NEW_CODEC_PARAMS_API so there may be problems there.\r\n\r\n# How it works\r\n\r\nAll the magic is inside v4l2sink.c which is heavily based on decoder.c and recorder.c\r\n\r\nIn practice it uses v4l2enc from libavdevice as muxer in the same way that recorder.c use mp4 or matroska.\r\n\r\nThe key difference here is that v4l2loopback and most v4l2 clients  expects to find a raw video frame and not an H264 encoded frame so like decoder.c it decodes the AVPacket to an AVFrame that is then re-encoded into an AVPacket with AV_CODEC_ID_RAWVIDEO.\r\nThe encoded packet is sent to v4l2enc and streamed to /dev/video0.\r\n\r\nThe code in v4l2sink.c and recorder.c are very similar and one can think that they can be merged together, but there are subtle differences here and there and for many reasons I prefer to keep them distinct.\r\n\r\n# RFC on known limitation\r\n\r\nThere is a limitation at the moment, it doesn't handle screen rotation, but it seems to be a [limit of v4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/issues/197) where you can't change the resolution as long as anyone is using the device.\r\n\r\nIn practice if you start with the phone in portrait it will work only in portrait, if you start in landscape it will work only in landscape. To change orientation you have to close both scrcpy and the receiving application, rotate the phone and restart. Closing only one of them doesn't work.\r\n\r\nUnless someone else come up with an idea to work around this I see two ways of handling this.\r\n\r\nIdea 1, scrcpy can rotate back the frame so at least the image will be visible and one can rotate in OBS or other programs without any problem.\r\n\r\nIdea 2, scrcpy can copy the frame centered in a squared texture. Eg, suppose that the frame is 720x1280, scrcpy will send to v4l2loopback a 1280x1280 texture with the frame centered and correctly rotated.\r\n\r\nIn your opinion what is the best solution? I see pro and cons in both of them.",

For some reason, `app_process` doesn't want to load it, so right now it's extracted to `/data/local/tmp` on initialization and cleaned up later.\r\n\r\n## Things you can help with\r\n\r\n- Testing:\r\n    - Comment whether it works on your device or not, so I can keep a list;\r\n    - Axes behavior;\r\n    - Multiple controllers.\r\n- Find a way to use the `ioctl` syscall without native code;\r\n- Load native libraries without extracting them;\r\n- Figure out multiple controllers with event injection.\r\n\r\n## To-do\r\n\r\n- [x] Add command line option for disabling game controllers\r\n- [x] Write tests\r\n- [x] Isolate uinput related stuff into another class (so other types of devices can be implemented)\r\n- [x] Fix input not working when uinput fails\r\n- [x] Support legacy uinput\r\n- [x] Look into event injection (for when uinput is unavailable)\r\n- [ ] Look into getting games to recognize axis movement when using event injection\r\n- [ ] Implement controller through event injection\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n\r\nI probably won't be adding some special features to this pull request, such as:\r\n- Vibration\r\n- Battery reporting\r\n- Lights\r\n- Touchpad\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback (suggestions, complaints, new info, ...), please don't hesitate to write it down below.\r\n\r\n## Tested devices\r\n\r\nManufacturer | Model | Android version | Last tested on | Tested by | Supported | Supported with root\r\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\r\nMotorola | Moto G<sup>5</sup> Plus | 8.1 | 2021-04-30 | @LHLaurini | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nMotorola | moto g(6) play | 9 | 2021-04-30 | @LHLaurini | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nSamsung | Galaxy A7 2018 | 10 | 2021-04-06 | @Fablo020 | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nSamsung | Galaxy M21s | 11 | 2021-04-30 | @LHLaurini | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nHuawei | Honor Play COR-L29 | 9 | 2021-05-01 | @Cannahawk | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nXiaomi | Pocophone F1 | 11 | 2021-05-23 | @Nightm4res | :grey_question: | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nSony | Xperia XZ1 Compact | 11 | 2021-06-14 | @Schlumpf7 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nSony | Xperia XZ | :grey_question: | 2021-06-15 | @Schlumpf7 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nBlackview | BV6000 | :grey_question: | 2021-06-15 | @Schlumpf7 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nXiaomi | Mi A3 | 11 | 2021-06-17 | @RuiGuilherme | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nNvidia | Shield TV | 11 | 2022-02-12 | @scaldav | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nBlackview | BV6300 Pro | 10 | 2022-05-02 | @Fancy2209 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nGoogle | Pixel 6 | 12 | 2022-06-02 | @AntoninHuaut | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nRedmi | Note 9 Pro 5G | 12 | 2022-06-18 | @esec | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nRedmi | Note 5 Pro | 11[*](#issuecomment-1160959261 \"LineageOS 18\") | 2022-06-20 | @Sigmacringe | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\n\r\nThe list of (un)supported devices can change anytime.\r\n\r\n### Reporting a new device\r\n\r\nIf you have tested with a device not on the list, please report it by writing a comment below.

        "body": "There are two problems with the scrcpy icon:\r\n 1. there is no scrcpy icon (it just uses a standard Android icon)\r\n 2. it's low definition (48\u00d748) (#1497)\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the latter.\r\n\r\n### Why was the icon in 48\u00d748?\r\n\r\nFor the initial release of scrcpy, to set an icon quickly (and in a funny way), I used an [XPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap): [`icon.xpm`](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/v1.0/app/src/icon.xpm).\r\nI explained here: https://blog.rom1v.com/2018/03/introducing-scrcpy/#set-a-window-icon\r\n\r\nI use XFCE, and the icons are never shown at a higher resolution, so it was not a problem for me. However, when the icon is displayed at a bigger size, the quality is awful: #1497.\r\n\r\n### Icon format\r\n\r\nTo support a higher resolution icon, I had to use another format.\r\n\r\nSDL expects a packed (non-planar) bitmap format, so I choose PNG (but other formats could be supported).\r\n\r\nTo avoid adding a new dependency, I implemented icon loading using FFmpeg (which is **not** the most straightforward way to just load an image!). For simplicity, I only implemented support for RGB-like input.\r\n\r\nThe icon is read from a file, either in `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/scrcpy.png` or just `icon.png` for portable builds (i.e. Windows). Like `SCRCPY_SERVER_PATH`, an environment variable allows to customize the icon path: `SCRCPY_ICON_PATH`. The main purpose is to be able to execute `./run x` to run a build without installing.\r\n\r\n### Debug mode\r\n\r\nTo easily distinguish debug builds, I used to change the icon color (because it was simple and funny): https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/431c9ee33b49f5ce7317b4c687e00bc436adbc02/app/src/tiny_xpm.c#L40-L43\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple with a real image, I will just abandon this debug-specific change.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n - ~~I'd like to add support for palette formats (`AV_PIX_FMT_PAL8`), in particular because it's the format produced by `optipng` if I optimize the current icon.~~ (DONE)\r\n - I'd like a real scrcpy icon :smile: ",

        "body": "This PR replaces the two previous attempts #1446 and #1465.\r\n\r\nIt forwards <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> to the device. This allows for example to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> in Firefox to open a new tab, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> to close the current tab. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> can now be injected in Termux.\r\n\r\nThis also greatly simplifies text selection, by using the keyboard (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+_arrows_, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>\u2026), and simplifies copy-paste (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>) and cut-paste (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>). <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd> could be used to cancel an action, like a change in a text field for example.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, scrcpy shortcuts are not bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> anymore, but to (left) <kbd>Alt</kbd> and (left) <kbd>Cmd</kbd> by default. This modifier can be changed by a command-line parameter (`--shortcut-mod`), as explained [here](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/1465#issuecomment-656388080).\r\n\r\nHere is the list of the changes:\r\n - all shortcuts now use the specified modifier key (called <kbd>MOD</kbd>), on all platforms\r\n - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> are forwarded to the device\r\n - to copy or cut a text, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> typically work, because they are forwarded to the device, which, in a text field, copies the text into the clipboard\u2026 and the clipboard is now automatically (since v1.14) synchronized with the computer keyboard\r\n - pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> synchronizes the computer clipboard to the device before sending the key event, therefore pasting typically works seamlessly\r\n - seamless copy-paste now also works before Android 7 with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> keys\r\n - <kbd>MOD</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>MOD</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>MOD</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> are also provided to inject `COPY`, `CUT` and `PASTE` keycodes (see [README](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/163eb4ba5e95f0ae590b65532267d75f2827965b/README.md#copy-paste) for details)\r\n - <kbd>MOD</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> injects the computer clipboard content as a sequence of key events (this is still useful sometimes)\r\n - to be able to bind `CUT` to <kbd>MOD</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>, the \"resize to fit\" shortcut (which removes the black borders) has been changed to <kbd>MOD</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>\r\n\r\nThis fixes #555 and #942.\r\n\r\nFeedbacks (and reviews) welcome :)\r\n\r\n## Binaries\r\n\r\nEDIT: just take v1.15 release.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>old</summary>\r\nFor windows users, take both `scrcpy.exe` and `scrcpy-server`, and replace them in your scrcpy v1.14 release.\r\n\r\nFor other platforms, take `scrcpy-server` and [build](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md#prebuilt-server) only the client.\r\n\r\n - [`scrcpy.exe`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/1598/2/scrcpy.exe)\r\n  _SHA256: ceab026bff28c8851456e30d3e1449ad25ef6aedeec6fcac00ad508e2f67a9cf_\r\n - [`scrcpy-server`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/1598/2/scrcpy-server)\r\n  _SHA256: b7b4f2f5d008cf6191c8fab6f74cc43bfc78bd33c4a4100274a9f4fa717b59e8_\r\n</details>",

This also allows to select text using the keyboard (`Shift`+arrows, `Ctrl`+`a`\u2026), and simplify copy-paste (`Ctrl`+`c`, `Ctrl`+`v`) and cut-paste (`Ctrl`+`x`, `Ctrl`+`v`).\r\n\r\nHere is the list of the changes:\r\n - all shortcuts now use the `RCtrl` (right `Ctrl`) key instead of any `Ctrl` key, on all platforms\r\n - in addition, on macOS, `Cmd` can be used (for shortcuts which are not already captured by the system) as before\r\n - `LCtrl` (left `Ctrl`) and `Shift`(both left and right) are forwarded to the device\r\n - to copy a text, `Ctrl`+`c` works, because it is forwarded to the device, which, in a text field, copy the text into the clipboard\u2026 and the clipboard is now automatically (since v1.13) synchronized with the computer keyboard.\r\n - for convenience, and as special cases, `RCtrl`+`c` (`Cmd`+`c`) and `RCtrl`+`x` (`Cmd`+`x`) are forwarded to the device as `Ctrl`+`c` and `Ctrl`+`x`\r\n - pressing `LCtrl`+`v` synchronizes the computer clipboard to the device before sending the key event, therefore pasting works seamlessly (and the old `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` shortcut has been removed)\r\n - `RCtrl`+`v` injects the computer clipboard content as a sequence of text events (this is still useful sometimes)\r\n - to support \"cut\" `RCtrl`+`x`, I changed the \"resize to fit\" (the shortcut which removes the black borders) from `RCtrl`+`x` (oldly `Ctrl`+`x`) to `RCtrl`+`w`\r\n - seamless copy-paste now also works before Android 7\r\n\r\nThis fixes #555 and #942.\r\n\r\nFeedbacks welcome :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Binaries\r\n\r\nFor windows users, take both `scrcpy.exe` and `scrcpy-server`, and replace them in your scrcpy v1.14 release.\r\n\r\nFor other platforms, take `scrcpy-server` and [build](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md#prebuilt-server) only the client.\r\n\r\n - [`scrcpy.exe`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/pr1465/1/scrcpy.exe)\r\n  _SHA256: a22661070827d47a08618bcaf8550688aa2c56b0053251ba45cebee5b9b45850_\r\n - [`scrcpy-server`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/pr1465/1/scrcpy-server)\r\n  _SHA256: 62f3cb793c8398e0f55f5e98be438be0c238ddb94efbdbbf0f76b7522ee51264_",

(commit a6dcbf34bade4d8d71bdac15c04ff1cd12ce9450)\r\n\r\nIt has several benefits:\r\n - it allows to avoid rounding inconsistencies between internal SDL logical size and the window size (causing 1 unexpected row/column of pixels blacks in the \"optimal size\")\r\n - it will make possible to draw visual feedback at the expected size (for #24 for example) in the future\r\n - above all, it fixes #15 :tada:\r\n\r\nI am now quite confident that it works correctly.\r\n\r\nBut since it impacts heavily the rendering and the event forwarding (which must NOT be broken at all), more tests from users are welcome:\r\n - if you can, also test with a secondary screen\r\n - check that clicks are correctly applied at the right position\r\n   - even if you resize so that there are black borders\r\n   - both in fullscreen or maximized or normal state\r\n   - with or without content rotation (`Ctrl`+`\u2190` / `Ctrl`+`\u2192`)\r\n - try to maximize, then fullscreen (both `Ctrl`+`f` and \"expand to fullscreen\", which behaves differently), rotate device, then unfullscreen (check that the window is correctly restored in maximized state), then unmaximize (check that the window is correctly restored at the correct size).\r\n - use the app normally, you could find other edge cases :)\r\n\r\n## Binaries\r\n\r\nTo simplify testing, here are binaries.\r\n\r\nFor windows users, take both `scrcpy.exe` and `scrcpy-server`, and replace them in your scrcpy v1.13 release.\r\n\r\nFor other platforms, take `scrcpy-server` and [build](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md#prebuilt-server) only the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n - [`scrcpy.exe`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/pr1408/scrcpy.exe)\r\n  _SHA256: 7d61f31c8e33aa1b70a43b38b7c40c7e5289683a959e8426b34c3a488a385186_\r\n - [`scrcpy-server`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/pr1408/scrcpy-server)\r\n  _SHA256: 6d124307e081b8bbccc478dcf82731aad3cc994e7502197c9bae3847d3169dc7_\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedbacks :wink:",

Especially on macOS (but not only) (because I don't have any macOS to test), especially with HiDPI (but not only), especially with a secondary monitor (#15) (but not only).\r\n\r\nPlease also test clicks after window rotation (Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right, a new feature in the next release).\r\n\r\nIn theory, this is the last remaining change I would like to merge before a new release.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedbacks.\r\n\r\nEDIT: please test `logical_size.8` instead",

The relevant commit is 63af7fbafe3740b17b5495a8230298eff9d45581._\r\n\r\nTo packetize the H.264 raw stream, av_parser_parse2() (called by `av_read_frame()`) knows that it has received a full frame only after it has received some data for the next frame. As a consequence, the client always waited until the next frame before sending the current frame to    the decoder!\r\n\r\nOn the device side, we know packets boundaries. To reduce latency, make the device always transmit the \"frame meta\" to packetize the stream manually (it was already implemented to send PTS, but only enabled on recording).\r\n    \r\nOn the client side, replace `av_read_frame()` by manual packetizing and parsing.\r\n\r\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50682518/replacing-av-read-frame-to-reduce-delay>\r\n<https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/3354>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm opening a pull request to get more tests before merging (the changes are quite sensitive), to avoid regressions.\r\n\r\nTo confirm that it actually reduces the end-to-end latency by 1 frame, I created a [video](https://dl.rom1v.com/counter/30fps.mp4) which increments a number at 30fps (every 33.3ms):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# requires ffmpeg and imagemagick\r\nfor i in {0..999}; do convert -size 400x400 xc:White -gravity Center -pointsize 200 -font DejaVu-Sans-Mono -annotate 0 $i $(printf '%03d' $i).png; done\r\nffmpeg -framerate 30 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -c:v libx264 -vf format=yuv420p 30fps.mp4\r\n```\r\n\r\nI run this video in VLC on Android, and start _scrcpy_.\r\n\r\nI compared the current master with this PR for both 1080x1920 (just running `scrcpy`) and 448x800 (running `scrcpy -m800`).\r\n\r\n## 1080x1920\r\n\r\n### on `master`\r\n\r\n![1080x1920_30fps_before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/61158567-98454800-a4f9-11e9-9c80-9f57cf0826e4.jpg)\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end latency is about 3 frames (~100ms).\r\n\r\n### on `lowlatency`\r\n\r\n![1080x1920_30fps_lowlatency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/61158568-98454800-a4f9-11e9-9faa-42d3d760b38f.jpg)\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end latency is about 2 frames (~67ms).\r\n\r\nOnce a packet is received by the client, on average, the frame is rendered **12ms** later.\r\n(with \"skip frames\" disabled, i.e. `--render-expired-frames`)\r\n\r\n## 448x800\r\n\r\n### on `master`\r\n\r\n![448x800_30fps_before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/61158565-97acb180-a4f9-11e9-8b43-9cb1ef6e41f9.jpg)\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end latency is about 2 frames (~67ms).\r\n\r\n### on `lowlatency`\r\n\r\n![448x800_30fps_lowlatency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/543275/61158566-97acb180-a4f9-11e9-9560-ad8ff1d73347.jpg)\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end latency is about 1 frame (~33ms).\r\n\r\nOnce a packet is received by the client, on average, the frame is rendered **8ms** later.\r\n(with \"skip frames\" disabled, i.e. `-m800 --render-expired-frames`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor now, I preserved the compatibility with [prebuilt server](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md#prebuilt-server) v1.9, so you can just:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit fetch origin && git checkout lowlatency\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen build as usual.\r\n\r\nFor windows users, I built a binary (replace the one from v1.9): [`scrcpy.exe`](https://tmp.rom1v.com/scrcpy/pr646/1/scrcpy.exe).\r\n_SHA-256: 6b8eae4eb4df811b6aa194320f00b51102cf3a254e432f353963863c82f362ea_\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedbacks :wink:",

Otherwise, it will push the file to /sdcard.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: npes87184 <npes87184@gmail.com>",
