So, I went ahead and implemented it similar to how we implemented it in Langchain, Snapchat, and Llama index.\r\n\r\nThis can give you the data you need to improve the docs and also get some visibility on what users are asking and wondering about.\r\n\r\nPs. I even did a little \ud83d\udc19 animation that matches the logo, hope you like it!\r\n\r\nHere is a demo video of the implementation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb299ahQJEU\r\n\r\nPlease let me know any changes, or suggestions that you might have. It would be super awesome to implement with you all.\r\n\r\nHopefully, you like it!\r\n\r\nA bit more background: I am one of the co-founders of Mendable.ai. We are supporters of open-source projects and we'd love to offer Mendable at no cost.\r\n\r\n### Changes \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\r\n\r\n- Implements an animated AI companion on the bottom right of the documentation page that answers users' questions about the AutoGPT docs.\r\n",

        "body": "### Background:\r\nIn the skill tree view of our application, users have the option to select among various test execution strategies, such as running a single test, a suite of tests, or all tests in a category. Previously, these options were represented and managed using strings, leading to potential issues with type safety, code readability, and maintenance. There was a need to enforce a more structured and type-safe approach to handle these test options.\r\n\r\n### Changes \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\r\nIn this pull request, we introduce a new `TestOption` enum to represent the different test execution options in a more structured and type-safe manner. We have also updated the relevant parts of the code where these test options are used, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the code.\r\n\r\n#### Added:\r\n- `TestOption` enum with values representing the distinct test execution options.\r\n- `TestOptionExtension` to provide a string description for each enum value, facilitating easy display in the UI.\r\n\r\n#### Updated:\r\n- Modified the `SkillTreeViewModel` to use the `TestOption` enum instead of strings for handling test options.\r\n- Updated the `TestSuiteButton` widget to utilize the `TestOption` enum and the associated extension for displaying options in the UI.\r\n- Refactored code where test options are processed to use the new enum, enhancing type safety and code clarity.\r\n\r\nBy transitioning to the `TestOption` enum, we eliminate the risk of typos and string inconsistencies, promote type safety, and make the code more self-documenting and easier to maintain. This change lays a foundation for more robust and clear code handling for test execution options in the skill tree view.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Scorecard \u2728\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCheck out our contribution guide:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing\r\n\r\n1.

This approach lacked type safety and required additional processing to extract and utilize artifact data. With the growing need for robust and efficient data handling mechanisms, there was an imperative to refactor this approach and introduce a class representation for artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Changes: \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\r\nIn this PR, we introduce the `Artifact` class, a well-structured, type-safe representation of artifact data, aligning with the provided JSON schema. This class facilitates efficient data handling, including easy deserialization from JSON received from the server.\r\n\r\n#### Added:\r\n- `Artifact` class with properties aligning with the artifact JSON schema.\r\n- `fromJson` method for deserializing JSON data into an `Artifact` object.\r\n- Updated data handling mechanisms to use the new `Artifact` class, enhancing type safety and code readability.\r\n\r\n#### Updated:\r\n- Refactored `onArtifactsButtonPressed` method to directly utilize the `Artifact` class, removing the need for type checking and casting.\r\n- Updated all occurrences of `List<dynamic>` artifact data handling to use `List<Artifact>` for enhanced type safety and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis refactor not only enhances code quality and readability but also ensures type safety and aligns with best practices for data handling in Flutter.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Scorecard \u2728\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCheck out our contribution guide:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing\r\n\r\n1.

        "body": "### Background\r\nPreviously, our OAuth 2.0 implementation for signing in with Google and GitHub was based on redirecting users to the respective authentication pages. This approach was effective but had some limitations, especially when the application was run in dynamic environments like GitHub Codespaces. Users encountered a \"400 Error: redirect URI mismatch\" because the dynamic URLs generated by Codespaces were not registered in the Google Cloud Console or GitHub OAuth Apps.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n#### Dynamic Redirect URIs\r\nWe've enhanced the OAuth 2.0 implementation by dynamically setting the redirect URIs based on the environment where the application is running. The application now automatically detects the current hostname and sets the OAuth 2.0 redirect URI accordingly. This change ensures compatibility with dynamic environments, providing a seamless user experience in GitHub Codespaces and similar platforms.\r\n\r\n#### Popup Authentication\r\nAdditionally, we've transitioned from the redirect method to popup authentication for both Google and GitHub sign-ins. This update offers users a more integrated and smooth sign-in experience by displaying a popup window for authentication, rather than navigating away from the application page.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Scorecard \u2728\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCheck out our contribution guide:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing\r\n\r\n1.

I saw benchmarks of BeeBot, MiniAGI & AutoGPT. Pretty cool stuff everyone's got. For the steps management, I copied some code ghostcoder-autogpt. But I promise to not simply copy paste someone else's work. I just wanted to test the steps thing and understand their implementation.\r\n- **Preliminary Ideas:** General AI Agent. Will take the best of whats the best in each benchmark.\r\n  \r\n#### \ud83c\udfc6 Prize Category\r\n\r\n- **Target Prize:** Grand Prize\r\n- **Why this Prize:** I am in a little financial stress, so it would greatly help. Also I am interested in this AI Agent thing. I have been trying to understand them better for much complex internal use cases.\r\n\r\n#### \ud83c\udfac Introduction Video\r\n\r\n- **Video Link:** WIP\r\n\r\n#### \ud83d\udcdd Notes and Compliance\r\n\r\n- **Additional Notes:** WIP\r\n- **Compliance with Hackathon Rules:** (Just a gentle reminder to stick to the rules outlined for the hackathon)\r\n\r\n#### \u2705 Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] We have read and are aligned with the [Hackathon Rules](https://lablab.ai/event/autogpt-arena-hacks).\r\n- [X] We confirm that our project will be open-source and adhere to the MIT License.\r\n- [X] Our lablab.ai registration email matches our OpenAI account to claim the bonus credits (if applicable).\r\n",

The `LeaderboardSubmissionDialog`\u2019s `_validateAndSubmit` method has been updated to be asynchronous to incorporate this new validation.

The UI did not provide options for executing different subsets of tests, and the logic handling the task execution was limited. The Test Suite Button was a `StatelessWidget`, and the task queue had an overlapping issue when the list got too long.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Test Execution Options\r\n- **Functionality Addition:** Integrated new options for test execution, allowing users to either run a single test, the whole category of tests, or a test and its ancestors, enhancing flexibility and user control.\r\n- **UI Update:** Refactored the Test Suite Button to include a dropdown menu, enabling users to easily select their preferred test execution option.\r\n\r\n#### Test Suite Button Refactor\r\n- **Old Implementation:** The Test Suite Button was a `StatelessWidget`.\r\n- **New Implementation:** Transformed it into a `StatefulWidget` for better state management and integrated a dropdown for selecting test execution options.\r\n\r\n#### Task Queue View Refactor\r\n- **Old Implementation:** The task queue was embedded within a `Stack`, causing overlap issues with long lists.\r\n- **New Implementation:** Transitioned the layout to a `Column`, utilizing an `Expanded` widget for the task list to avert overlap problems.\r\n\r\n#### Skill Tree View Model Update\r\n- **Functionality Addition:** Implemented logic to populate the selected node hierarchy data source based on the user\u2019s selected option from the dropdown, facilitating different subsets of tests to be run.\r\n\r\n### Summary of User Impact\r\nUsers can now select different subsets of tests to run, offering enhanced control and flexibility in test execution. The refactor ensures the task list is displayed correctly without overlap, and tasks are added in the accurate order. \r\n\r\n### Files Changed\r\n- **Test Suite Button:** Transitioned to a stateful widget, integrated a dropdown for test option selection.\r\n- **Task Queue View:** Addressed the UI overlap issue with a layout refactor.\r\n- **Skill Tree View Model:** Introduced logic for dynamic node addition based on user selection and fixed the endless loop bug.\r\n\r\nThese updates collectively enhance the application\u2019s usability, giving users more control over test execution while ensuring a streamlined and bug-free user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Scorecard \u2728\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCheck out our contribution guide:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
