I would like to add that I started by trying to add doctests to matrix_chain_order.py script under Python/dynamic_programming/matrix_chain_order in order to improve its test coverage. However, I found the functions poorly written. Instead of changing the code, I have written a separate script with bug free code, problem explanation and required doctests.

This code uses a class-based approach to model jobs, where each job has a name, priority, burst time, and a sequentially assigned job number. The priority round robin scheduling algorithm is applied to execute the jobs.\r\n\r\nChanges Made:\r\n- Added a `Job` class with attributes for name, priority, burst time, and a sequentially assigned job number.\r\n- Implemented a `priority_rr_scheduling` function to perform priority round robin scheduling.\r\n- The code takes user input for the total number of jobs, job names, priorities, burst times, and the time quantum.\r\n- Automatically assigns job numbers to each job in sequential order.\r\n- Prints the order in which jobs are completed and the time at which each job completes its execution.\r\n\r\nFile Name: priority_rr_scheduler.py\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

It has an input layer, a hidden layer with a tanh activation, and an output layer.\r\n\r\nThe init() method initializes the weight matrices and bias vectors randomly.\r\n\r\nThe forward() method performs the feedforward pass, calculating the outputs from the input data using the weights/biases.\r\n\r\nThe fit() method trains the network using backpropagation and gradient descent. It:\r\n\r\nMakes predictions\r\nCalculates the loss\r\nComputes gradients of the loss with respect to the weights/biases\r\nUpdates the weights/biases to reduce the loss\r\nThis allows the MLP to learn non-linear functions approximators and fit to training data for tasks like classification. The network is trained iteratively using backprop and gradient descent to minimize the loss.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the MLP class implements a basic neural network that can be trained on data to perform machine learning tasks by learning to make data-driven predictions and decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [x] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

        "body": "The provided Python script offers a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a renowned combinatorial optimization challenge. The approach employed in this code is a straightforward brute-force method that exhaustively explores all possible permutations of a given set of points to identify the optimal path. To begin, the script imports the permutations function from the itertools library, which plays a pivotal role in generating every conceivable permutation of the input points. A calculate_total_distance function computes the overall distance for a given order of points by employing the Euclidean distance formula. The heart of the code, the tsp_bruteforce function, iterates through these permutations, calculating their distances and maintaining records of the best path and its total distance. The main function functions as the program's entry point, soliciting user input to determine the number of points and their coordinates. Upon receiving user input, the script engages the TSP solver to identify the most efficient path and compute its total distance. If executed directly, rather than being imported as a module, the script initiates the TSP solving process.\r\n\r\n### Describe your change:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [ ] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [ ] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.

At each step, an ant chooses the next node to visit based on a combination of pheromone levels and the distance to the node.\r\nSolution Construction: Ants construct solutions by iteratively moving from one node to another. They continue until all nodes are visited.\r\n3 ] Pheromone Update: After all ants have completed their tours, pheromone levels are updated. Edges that are part of better solutions receive more pheromone. \r\n4 ] Iteration: Steps 2-4 are repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping condition is met.\r\n5 ] Solution Improvement: The best solution found by the ants is considered the result of the optimization process.\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n* [x] I have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n* [x] This pull request is all my own work -- I have not plagiarized.\r\n* [x] I know that pull requests will not be merged if they fail the automated tests.\r\n* [x] This PR only changes one algorithm file.
