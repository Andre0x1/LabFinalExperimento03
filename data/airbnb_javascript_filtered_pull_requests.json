I took the initiative to submit a [\"Pull Requests\"](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2724) adding it in a separate roadmap section.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and effort in maintaining this valuable resource :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMouaaz",

Separately, at this point I'm not sure who's still using eslint 5 or 6, considering how much new syntax requires eslint 7 or 8 to support (even via babel's or typescript's eslint parser) and how hungry people often are for new syntax.\r\n\r\nDue to the way we share packages in this quasi-monorepo, I've been forced to disable a number of tests. These will be re-enabled once I open the PR to update the react config (after the base config is published) which hopefully won't be too long (and I won't be making any meaningful changes to the react config during that gap anyways).\r\n\r\nThis resolves part of #2478.",

And you shouldn't be forced to make a component a public export if it's really just an internal implementation detail of another component.\r\n\r\nThere's an argument to be made about _exporting_ multiple components, but mostly just in the context of React.lazy because it can only import default exports and you don't want something else in that file being statically imported (because that will prevent it from being code-split).\r\n\r\nRe: https://twitter.com/ljharb/status/1096126116069138432",
