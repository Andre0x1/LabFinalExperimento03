        "body": "Issue #50320 shows that in some cases, updating a signal that's a dependency of a template during change detection of that template can have several adverse effects. This can happen, for example, if the signal is set during the lifecycle hook of a directive within the same template that reads the signal.\r\n\r\nThis can cause a few things to happen:\r\n\r\n* Straightforwardly, it can cause `ExpressionChanged` errors.\r\n* Surprisingly, it can cause an assertion within the `ReactiveLViewConsumer` to fail.\r\n* Very surprisingly, it can cause change detection for an `OnPush` component to stop working.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of these later behaviors is subtle, and is ultimately a desync between the reactive graph and the view tree's notion of \"dirty\" for a given view. This will be fixed with further work planned for change detection to handle such updates directly. Until then, this commit improves the DX through two changes:\r\n\r\n1. The mechanism of \"committing\" `ReactiveLViewConsumer`s to a view is changed to use the `consumerOnSignalRead` hook from the reactive graph. This prevents the situation which required the assertion in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. A `console.warn` warning is added when a view is marked dirty via a signal while it's still executing.\r\n\r\nThe warning informs users that they're pushing data against the direction of change detection, risking `ExpressionChanged` or other issues. It's a warning and not an error because the check is overly broad and captures situations where the application would not actually break as a result, such as if a `computed` marked the template dirty but still returned the same value.\r\n",

It looks like performance.mark exists everywhere this code might be executed.\r\n\r\n**Is there a way to test this?** I couldn't find one on short notice. This would have to be tested in e2e tests, and I haven't yet found a way to check for performance entries using Selenium. Would be happy to add a test if anyone has any input on this.\r\n",

When the inheritance strategy is \"emptyOnly\", this isn't necessarily the root of the tree, but some point along the way (it stops once it reaches an ancestor route with a component).\r\n\r\nInstead, this commit updates parameter inheritance to only inherit data directly from the parent route (again, instead of recomputing all inherited data back to the inheritance root). The only requirement for making this work is that the parent route data has already calculated and updated its own inherited data. This was really already a requirement -- parents need to be processed before children.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the update to the inheritance algorithm in this commit requires more of an understanding that a resolver running higher up in the tree has to propagate inherited data downwards. The previous algorithm hid this knowledge because resolvers would recompute inherited data from the root when run. However, routes that did not have resolvers rerun or never had resolvers at all would not get the updated resolved data.\r\n\r\nfixes #51934\r\n",

  migrating from the previously used ==. NgSwitch expressions and / or\n    individual condition values need adjusting to this stricter equality\n    check. The added warning message should help pinpointing NgSwitch\n    usages where adjustements are needed.\n\n##### core\n\n-   The  `mutate` method was removed from the `WritableSignal` interface and completely\n    dropped from the public API surface. As an alternative please use the update method and\n    make immutable changes to the object.\n\n    Example before:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.mutate(itemsArray => itemsArray.push(newItem));\n    ```\n\n    Example after:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.update(itemsArray => [itemsArray, \u2026newItem]);\n    ```\n-   The  `mutate` method was removed from the `WritableSignal` interface and completely\n    dropped from the public API surface. As an alternative please use the update method and\n    make immutable changes to the object.\n\n    Example before:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.mutate(itemsArray => itemsArray.push(newItem));\n    ```\n\n    Example after:\n\n    ```typescript\n    items.update(itemsArray => [itemsArray, \u2026newItem]);\n    ```\n\n##### platform-browser\n\n-   The `withNoDomReuse()` function was removed from the public API. If you need to disable hydration, you can exclude the `provideClientHydration()` call from provider list in your application (which would disable hydration features for the entire application) or use `ngSkipHydration` attribute to disable hydration for particular components. See this guide for additional information: https://angular.io/guide/hydration#how-to-skip-hydration-for-particular-components.\n\n##### router\n\n-   Routes with `loadComponent` would incorrectly cause\n    child routes to inherit their data by default. The default\n    `paramsInheritanceStrategy` is `emptyOnly`. If parent data should be\n    inherited in child routes, this should be manually set to `always`.\n\n##### benchpress\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [2da3551a70](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/2da3551a703ebef401d76a8e88e388437e851d85) | feat | report gc and render time spent in script ([#&#8203;50771](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/50771)) |\n\n##### common\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [da056a1fe2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/da056a1fe2816299319fb3f87416316be2029479) | fix | add missing types field for @&#8203;angular/common/locales of exports in package.json ([#&#8203;52080](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52080)) |\n| [85843e8212](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/85843e8212e99deb8b70f3d3f8dfe002b978cbb1) | fix | allow to specify only some properties of `DatePipeConfig` ([#&#8203;51287](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51287)) |\n| [28a5925f53](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/28a5925f53790067d45f1f68d204a36088dbf5e3) | fix | use === operator to match NgSwitch cases ([#&#8203;51504](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51504)) |\n\n##### compiler\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [1934524a0c](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/1934524a0c673fb65cd927c55c712f59446f9c93) | feat | add docs extraction for type aliases ([#&#8203;52118](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52118)) |\n| [7bfe20707f](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7bfe20707fedff7290e12356a1545644b436d41c) | feat | extract api for fn overloads and abtract classes ([#&#8203;52040](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52040)) |\n| [7dbd47fb30](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/7dbd47fb3015117c420f984181bfcb48e533525a) | fix | allow newlines in track and let expressions ([#&#8203;52137](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52137)) |\n| [9d19c8e317](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/9d19c8e31752d211f575246282358b83afe90969) | fix | don't allocate variable to for loop expression ([#&#8203;52158](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52158)) |\n| [16ff08ec70](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/16ff08ec70bfa192041ba050e550676e8d505a05) | fix | narrow the type of expressions in event listeners inside if blocks ([#&#8203;52069](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52069)) |\n| [ac0d5dcfd6](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/ac0d5dcfd6015ec4283ed1a5cf241f130f4c5cf5) | fix | narrow the type of expressions in event listeners inside switch blocks ([#&#8203;52069](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52069)) |\n| [17078a3fe1](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/17078a3fe1e9b90e48952b6c12b6e6b774b97810) | fix | pipes used inside defer triggers not being picked up ([#&#8203;52071](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52071)) |\n| [861ce3a7c5](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/861ce3a7c574340a6164ad0de13f49bda3e172da) | fix | pipes using DI not working in blocks ([#&#8203;52112](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52112)) |\n| [386e1e9500](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/386e1e950033ad98661e5077a4f119df0e7b3008) | fix | work around TypeScript bug when narrowing switch statements ([#&#8203;52110](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52110)) |\n\n##### compiler-cli\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [11bb19cafc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/11bb19cafcf447b7ce6ade146d431a43c3e2c682) | fix | handle nested qualified names in ctor injection in local compilation mode ([#&#8203;51947](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51947)) |\n\n##### core\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| [50275e58b8](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/50275e58b80acfc52239908a6c61523e99f6731c) | feat | Add schematic to migrate control flow syntax ([#&#8203;52035](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52035)) |\n| [048f400efc](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/048f400efc75011e888ea25d214a0211f91b96d4) | feat | add warnings for oversized images and lazy-lcp ([#&#8203;51846](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51846)) |\n| [4427e1ebc2](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/4427e1ebc29f5541cfe6a404f212de4359441812) | feat | create function to assert not running inside reactive context ([#&#8203;52049](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/52049)) |\n| [5b88d136af](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/5b88d136affdaa35e7015c00281b86cae040321b) | feat | mark core signal APIs as stable ([#&#8203;51821](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/pull/51821)) |\n| [8eef694def](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/commit/8eef694def3dc660779168925a380179c7e30993) | feat | Provide a diagnostic for missing Signal invocation in template interpolation.

Removing the outer-most parenthesis from the switch expression - this works and allows us to continue using switch statements, but because we use parenthesized expressions to map diagnostics to their template locations, I wasn't sure if it won't lead to worse template dignostics.\r\n\r\nFixes #52077.",

After more thorough investigatio and consideration with the team, we feel like allowing `toSignal` to be called in such contexts is encouraging non-ideal / hard-to-notice code patterns.\r\n\r\ne.g. a new subscription to an observable is made every time `toSignal` is invoked. There is no caching done here. Additionally, multiple new subscriptions can trigger unintended side-effects- that may slow down the app, result in incorrect/unexpected behavior or perform unnecessary work.\r\n\r\nUsers should instead move the `toSignal` call outside of the `computed` or `effect` and then read the signal values from within their `computed`. e.g.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncomputed(() => {\r\n  const smth = toSignal(coldObservable$)\r\n  return smth() + 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n--> should instead be:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst smth = toSignal(coldObsverable$);\r\ncomputed(() => smth() + 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn cases where a new subscription for each invocation is actually intended, a manual subscription can be made. That way it's also much more obvious to users that they are triggering side-effects every time, or causing new subscriptions.",

Also logs an error about the incomplete block.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): introduce unknown block node\r\nAdds an `UnknownBlock` node to the Ivy AST to represent blocks that haven't been recognized by the compiler.

However, we noticed that it didn't work as expected and the stylesheets were still being created for each component initialisation, and worse the previously disabled stylesheets would remain in the document head and continue to grow as the user navigated around the app.\r\n\r\nYou can see a simple repro of this bug [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-t421aj?file=src%2Fmain.ts).\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nStylesheets are now correctly re-used when components are destroyed and re-created, and no duplicates are created.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n",

This will allow developers to do things like add/remove classes from the DOM when the transition animation is finished, skip the transition based on application conditions, etc. Having access to the transition unlocks just about every example outlined in https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions.\r\n\r\nNote that the timing of the `updateCallback` execution is in the spec as being called asyncronously (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-1/#callbackdef-updatecallback). This means the `onViewTransitionCreated` callback is guaranteed to execute before the update callback which in turn means it is guaranteed to execute before the view transition `ready`/animation. As a result, it is safe/effictive to add classes to the document in the `onViewTransitionCreated` function in order to control animations of that transition and then remove those classes in the transition's `finished` `Promise`. The animation also doesn't start until the `Promise` returned by `updateCallback` resolves, so this would also guarantee that the animation starts asynchronously.\r\n\r\nresolves #51827\r\n",

Please describe:\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\nActual CSSSelector.parse function doesn't parse real CSS.\r\nEvery new coworker i'm training on Angular since 6 years, doesn't understand how directive's selector work, because they keep trying to use valid CSS , for the small proportion of them who understand CSS. The rest just give up with very basic selector. \r\n\r\nI know docs explain how this selector work, but a lot of developer try to cross element boundaries ( despite the documentation ), and the compiler doesn't flinch a bit.\r\n\r\nFor exemple :\r\n* `input[type^=text]` is parsed as `text`\r\n* `.hover input`  is parsed as `input.hover`\r\n* `input > .selected`  , `.selected input` and `input.selected`  are parsed as `input.selected`\r\n\r\nI extracted the actual CSSSelector parser in this github page to show my teams how they can improve their directive's selector : https://ydomenjoud.github.io/angular-selector-parser/ \r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThe purpose of this pull request is to throw explicit error on wrong, or unsupported selector syntax. With theses errors : \r\n ```\r\n  NotInNot = 'Nesting :not in a selector is not allowed',\r\n  CommaInNot = 'Multiple selectors in :not are not supported',\r\n  PseudoElement = 'Pseudo element are not supported',\r\n  Combinators = 'CSS combinators (> + ~ \"space\" ) are not supported',\r\n  MultipleTagName = 'Multiple tagName are not allowed',\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added unit test to cover this upgrade, add missing test for internal :svg:* syntax ( uncovered before )\r\nAnd removed some NBSP added by previous commit\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\nWrong Directive syntax which were valid with previous parser will throw error with this new one. \r\nIf this suits you better, I can switch to warning instead.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\nLove Angular so much for so many years now :)\r\nthanks for all your work\r\n",

All the configutation is passed\nto `createParser()` params.\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\nvar CssSelectorParser = require('css-selector-parser').CssSelectorParser,\nparser = new CssSelectorParser();\nparser.registerSelectorPseudos('has');\nparser.registerNumericPseudos('nth-child');\nparser.registerNestingOperators('>', '+', '~');\nparser.registerAttrEqualityMods('^', '$', '*', '~');\n\nconst selector = parser.parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:lt($var):nth-child(5)');\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({\n    syntax: {\n        pseudoClasses: {\n            // In 1.x any pseudo-classes were accepted.\n            // in 2.x parser only accepts known psuedo-classes unless `unknown: accept` was specified. \n            unknown: 'accept',\n            definitions: {\n                // This is a replacement for registerSelectorPseudos().\n                Selector: ['has'],\n                // This is a replacement for registerNumericPseudos().\n                Formula: ['nth-child']\n            }\n        },\n        // This is a replacement for registerNestingOperators().\n        combinators: ['>', '+', '~'],\n        attributes: {\n            // This a replacement for registerAttrEqualityMods().\n            // Note that equals sign (\"=\") is included into the operator definitions.\n            operators: ['^=', '$=', '*=', '~=']\n        }\n    },\n    // This is a replacement for enableSubstitutes()\n    substitutes: true\n});\n\nconst selector = parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:lt($var):nth-child(5)');\n```\n\n-   [All syntax definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md)\n-   [All the psudo-class definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md#pseudoclasses)\n-   [All the attribute definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md#attributes)\n\n##### Predefined CSS syntax definitions\n\nYou no longer need to make an extensive configuration of `css-selector-parser` in order to make it understand\nthe necessary CSS standards. You can now just define CSS/CSS selectors version directly:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'css3'});\n\nconst selector = parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:nth-child(2n + 1)::before');\n```\n\nHere are the pre-defined CSS standards for your disposal:\n\n-   `css1`: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/\n-   `css2`: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/\n-   `css3`/`selectors-3`: https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/\n-   `selectors-4`: https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/\n-   `latest`: refers to `selectors-4`\n-   `progressive`: `latest` + accepts unknown psudo-classes, psudo-elements and attribute case sensitivity modifiers\n\n##### Make sure you use proper `strict` value\n\nCSS selector parser in modern browsers is very forgiving. For instance, it works fine with unclosed attribute\nselectors: `\"[attr=value\"`. If you would like to mimic this behavior from browsers, set `strict` to `false`, i.e.:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'css3', strict: false});\n\nconst selector = parse(':lang(en'); // doesn't crash\n```\n\n##### Render is now a separate export\n\n`render()` method used to be a method of `CssSelectorParser` class. Now it can be imported directly and used.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser, render} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'progressive'});\n\nconst selector = parse('div#user-123.user:lang(en)::before');\n\nconsole.log(render(selector)); // div#user-123.user:lang(en)::before\n```\n\n##### AST changes\n\nAST had a lot of changes.\n\n##### Selector\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstSelector.md)\n\n1.  Type changed: `selector` -> `Selector`.\n2.  Prop changed: `selectors` -> `rules`, also `selectors` contained `ruleSet[]`, which in turn has `rule` field,\n    and new `rules` contains `Rule[]` directly.\n\nBefore: `{type: 'selector', selectors: [ {type: 'ruleSet', rule: {<RULE 1 DATA>}}, {type: 'ruleSet', rule: {<RULE 2 DATA>}} ]}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Selector', rules: [ {<RULE 1 DATA>}, {<RULE 2 DATA>} ]}`.\n\n##### Rule\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstRule.md)\n\n1.  Type changed: `rule` -> `Rule`.\n2.  Prop changed: `id: string` -> `items: [{type: 'Id', name: '<ID>'}, ...]`. According to the CSS spec one rule may have\n    more than 1 `id`, so `#root#root` is a valid selector.\n3.  Prop renamed: `nestingOperator` -> `combinator`. A proper name according to CSS spec was chosen.\n4.  Prop renamed: `rule` -> `nestedRule`. A proper name to indicate nesting was chosen.\n5.  Prop changed: `tagName: string` -> `items: [TagName | WildcardTag, ...]`. Using explicit distinction between\n    TagName (i.e. `div`) and WildcardTag (`*`), because tag name can also be `*` if escaped properly (`\\*`).\n6.  Prop changed: `attrs` -> `items: [<ATTRIBUTE>, ...]`. Attribute type was changed, see below.\n7.  Prop changed: `pseudos` -> `items: [<PSEUDO CLASS>, ...]`. There are pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, now they are\n    separated properly (there is a separate `pseudoElement` type). Pseudo class type was changed, see below.\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\n({\n    type: 'rule',\n    tagName: 'div',\n    id: 'user-123',\n    classNames: ['user'],\n    attrs: [\n        {name: 'role', operator: '$=', valueType: 'string', value: 'button'}\n    ],\n    pseudos: [\n        {name: 'lang', valueType: 'string', value: 'en'}\n    ],\n    nestingOperator: '>'\n})\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\n({\n    type: 'Rule',\n    items: [\n       {type: 'TagName', name: 'div'},\n       {type: 'Id', name: 'user-123'},\n       {type: 'ClassName', name: 'user'},\n       {type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '$=', value: {type: 'String', value: 'button'}},\n       {type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', value: {type: 'String', value: 'en'}}\n    ],\n    combinator: '>'\n})\n```\n\n##### Attribute\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstAttribute.md)\n\n1.  Type introduced: `Attribute`.\n2.  Prop `value` and `valueType` were combined to a single prop `value` with a field `type`.\n\n[All possible value types.](docs/interfaces/AstAttribute.md#value)\n\n##### Example 1\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role'}`.\n\n##### Example 2\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role', operator: '$=', valueType: 'string', value: 'button'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '$=', value: {type: 'String', value: 'button'}}`.\n\n##### Example 3\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role', operator: '=', valueType: 'substitute', value: 'var'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '=', value: {type: 'Substitute', name: 'var'}}`.\n\n##### Pseudo Classes\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoClass.md)\n\n1.  Type introduced: `PseudoClass`.\n2.  Prop `value` and `valueType` were combined to a single prop `argument` with a field `type`.\n\n[All possible argument types.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoClass.md#argument)\n\n##### Example 1\n\nBefore: `{name: 'visited'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'visited'}`.\n\n##### Example 2\n\nBefore: `{name: 'lang', valueType: 'string', value: 'en'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', argument: {type: 'String', value: 'en'}}`.\n\n##### Example 3\n\nBefore: `{name: 'lang', valueType: 'substitute', value: 'var'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', argument: {type: 'Substitute', name: 'var'}}`.\n\n##### Example 4\n\nBefore: `{name: 'has', valueType: 'selector', value: {type: 'selector', selectors: [{type: 'ruleSet', rule: {type: 'rule', tagName: 'div'}}]}}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'has', argument: {type: 'Selector', rules: [{type: 'Rule', tag: {type: 'TagName', name: 'div'}}]}}`.\n\n##### Pseudo Elements\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoElement.md)\n\n1.

Consider the following template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<button [title]=\"myTitle\" [id]=\"(auth().identity() | async)\" [tabindex]=\"1\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n`TemplateDefinitionBuilder` allocates the following variable (binding) slots:\r\n\r\nv[0] = [title] binding\r\nv[1] = [id] binding\r\nv[2] = [tabindex] binding\r\nv[3] = pipe binding\r\nv[4] = pipe binding\r\n\r\nAs you can see, all three top-level property bindings were assigned variable indices. Then, variables for nested expressions were assigned.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, Template Pipeline would choose the following order:\r\n\r\nv[0] = [title] binding\r\nv[1] = [id] binding\r\nv[2] = pipe binding\r\nv[3] = pipe binding\r\nv[4] = [tabindex] binding\r\n\r\nWith this order, nested expressions have their variables counted and assigned before subsequent top-level property bindings. This results in different variable indices for `pipeBinding` expressions that are not inside the final property binding.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not just different -- it's actually incorrect! Consider a case like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<button [p1]=\"c ? (a | pipe) : 3\" [p2]=\"b | pipe\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese pipe bindings are executed *conditionally*. This means that, because we don't count and assign all the \"fixed\" variable slots first, i.e. those belonging to the property bindings, their indices might end up incorrect, depending on whether or not a pipeBinding happened as part of the update block.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we count all variables on top-level ops first, and then descend into all expressions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nrefactor(compiler): Emit pure functions as arrow functions\r\n\r\nWe were previously emitting pure functions as `function foo(args) {return bar;}`, but `TemplateDefinitionBuilder` uses arrow functions instead (`const foo = (args) => bar`). By matching this behavior, we can enable many additional tests.\r\n",

configurations may need to be adjusted to prevent infinite\n    redirects where additional redirects were previously ignored after an\n    absolute redirect occurred.\n-   The `setupTestingRouter` function has been removed. Use\n    `RouterModule.forRoot` or `provideRouter` to setup the `Router` for\n    tests instead.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n##### animations\n\n-   The `AnimationDriver.NOOP` symbol is deprecated, use `NoopAnimationDriver` instead.\n\n##### animations\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

[`v17.0.0-next.5`](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1700-next5-2023-09-20)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/angular/angular/compare/17.0.0-next.4...17.0.0-next.5)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n#####\n\n-   Node.js v16 support has been removed and the minimum support version has been bumped to 18.13.0.\n\n    Node.js v16 is planned to be End-of-Life on 2023-09-11. Angular will stop supporting Node.js v16 in Angular v17. For Node.js release schedule details, please see: https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule\n\n##### common\n\n-\n\n##### core\n\n-   Angular now required `zone.js` version `~0.14.0`\n-   Versions of TypeScript older than 5.2 are no longer supported.\n\n##### router\n\n-   `malformedUriErrorHandler` is no longer available in\n    the `RouterModule.forRoot` options. URL parsing errors should instead be\n    handled in the `UrlSerializer.parse` method.\n\n##### zone.js\n\n-   Deep and legacy `dist/` imports like `zone.js/bundles/zone-testing.js` and `zone.js/dist/zone` are no longer allowed. `zone-testing-bundle` and `zone-testing-node-bundle` are also no longer part of the package.\n\n    The proper way to import `zone.js` and `zone.js/testing` is:\n\n    ```js\n    import 'zone.js';\n    import 'zone.js/testing';\n    ```\n\n#####\n\n| Commit | Type | Description |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n|

        "body": "This PR adds two new warnings related to image performance to Angular. These warnings are based on existing warning in the NgOptimizedImage directive, but apply to all images, as opposed to just those generated with NgOptimizedImage. The rationale for this is that both of the image performance issues captured by these warnings apply equally to images that don't use the optimized image directive. By surfacing them as warnings, we can help improve Angular loading performance and Core Web Vitals. \r\n\r\nThe two warnings are: \r\n1) Lazy-loaded-LCP: Fires when the the scanner discovers that an image which is the LCP element has been rendered with `loading=\"lazy'`. This can have a strong negative impact on LCP.\r\n2) Oversized image: Fires when the scanner detects an image where the intrinsic height or width are more than 1200 pixels larger than the rendered height or width.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the scanner runs once, on the page `load` event.\r\n\r\nCC: @AndrewKushnir @kara @dgp1130 ",

This will be used to generate the new instructions for `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction`.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement final instruction generation for interaction triggers\r\nUpdates the logic that generates the instructions for the `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction` triggers to their final shape. Now the instructions take two arguments:\r\n1. `triggerIndex` - index at which to find the trigger in the view where it will be rendered.\r\n2. `walkUpTimes` - tells the runtime how many views up it needs to go to find the trigger element. If the argument is omitted, it means that the trigger is in the same view as the deferred block. A positive number means that the runtime needs to go up X amount of times to find the trigger. A negative number means that the trigger is inside the root view of the placeholder block. Negative numbers are capped at -1 since the placeholder is always in the same position at runtime.\r\n\r\n### feat(core): implement deferred block interaction triggers\r\nAdds the implementation for the `on interaction` and `prefetch on interaction` triggers.",

Such cases are very difficult to debug as the dev has no clue why the component was not rendered. As bad as this pattern is, fixing all such tools for a better error handling is beyond the scope of our effort. Instead, in this change we print the error messages coming from calculating component dependencies (part of component rendering) to the console for a better visibility into the error. This change only affects local compilation where the component dependencies are calculated in runtime. This change can potentially shed light into many failures of local compilation in g3.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

        "body": "These changes include some refactors to facilitate the implementation of the `viewport`, `interaction` and `hover` triggers. The majority of the changes is around reworking the `R3TargetBinder` to consider `if`, `switch` and `defer` blocks (plus the sub-blocks) as separate embedded views. This allows us to properly resolve references within their scope and is consistent with how they behave at runtime. Split up across the following commits to make it easier to review:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): require a reference in interaction and hover triggers\r\nUpdates the parsing for `interaction` and `hover` triggers to require a reference to an element.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): update binder to account for new semantics\r\nWhen the `TargetBinder` was written, the only embedded-view-based nodes were templates, but now we have `{#if}`, `{#switch}` and `{#defer}` which have similar semantics. These changes rework the binder to account for the new nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): add utility to resolve the deferred block trigger element\r\nAdds a utility to the `BoundTarget` that helps with resolving which element a deferred block is pointing to. We need a separate method for this, because deferred blocks have some special logic for where the trigger can be located.",

These tests also happen to be the only ones that don't pass in the `files` argument of `NgtscTestEnvironment.setup`. When `files` isn't passed in, we don't hit the file path that sets up the `MockFileSystem`. With these changes I make it so that we always initialize the mock file system.\r\n2. The missing file system error usually comes from the `absoluteFrom` call that initializes the optional `workingDir` argument. My theory is that because it's a default value for an argument, it gets called too early before everything is initialized. These changes move the `absoluteFrom` call further down until it's needed.",

All the configutation is passed\nto `createParser()` params.\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\nvar CssSelectorParser = require('css-selector-parser').CssSelectorParser,\nparser = new CssSelectorParser();\nparser.registerSelectorPseudos('has');\nparser.registerNumericPseudos('nth-child');\nparser.registerNestingOperators('>', '+', '~');\nparser.registerAttrEqualityMods('^', '$', '*', '~');\n\nconst selector = parser.parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:lt($var):nth-child(5)');\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({\n    syntax: {\n        pseudoClasses: {\n            // In 1.x any pseudo-classes were accepted.\n            // in 2.x parser only accepts known psuedo-classes unless `unknown: accept` was specified. \n            unknown: 'accept',\n            definitions: {\n                // This is a replacement for registerSelectorPseudos().\n                Selector: ['has'],\n                // This is a replacement for registerNumericPseudos().\n                Formula: ['nth-child']\n            }\n        },\n        // This is a replacement for registerNestingOperators().\n        combinators: ['>', '+', '~'],\n        attributes: {\n            // This a replacement for registerAttrEqualityMods().\n            // Note that equals sign (\"=\") is included into the operator definitions.\n            operators: ['^=', '$=', '*=', '~=']\n        }\n    },\n    // This is a replacement for enableSubstitutes()\n    substitutes: true\n});\n\nconst selector = parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:lt($var):nth-child(5)');\n```\n\n-   [All syntax definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md)\n-   [All the psudo-class definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md#pseudoclasses)\n-   [All the attribute definition options.](docs/interfaces/SyntaxDefinition.md#attributes)\n\n##### Predefined CSS syntax definitions\n\nYou no longer need to make an extensive configuration of `css-selector-parser` in order to make it understand\nthe necessary CSS standards. You can now just define CSS/CSS selectors version directly:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'css3'});\n\nconst selector = parse('a[href^=/], .container:has(nav) > a[href]:nth-child(2n + 1)::before');\n```\n\nHere are the pre-defined CSS standards for your disposal:\n\n-   `css1`: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/\n-   `css2`: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/\n-   `css3`/`selectors-3`: https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/\n-   `selectors-4`: https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/\n-   `latest`: refers to `selectors-4`\n-   `progressive`: `latest` + accepts unknown psudo-classes, psudo-elements and attribute case sensitivity modifiers\n\n##### Make sure you use proper `strict` value\n\nCSS selector parser in modern browsers is very forgiving. For instance, it works fine with unclosed attribute\nselectors: `\"[attr=value\"`. If you would like to mimic this behavior from browsers, set `strict` to `false`, i.e.:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'css3', strict: false});\n\nconst selector = parse(':lang(en'); // doesn't crash\n```\n\n##### Render is now a separate export\n\n`render()` method used to be a method of `CssSelectorParser` class. Now it can be imported directly and used.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport {createParser, render} from 'css-selector-parser';\n\nconst parse = createParser({syntax: 'progressive'});\n\nconst selector = parse('div#user-123.user:lang(en)');\n\nconsole.log(render(selector)); // div#user-123.user:lang(en)\n```\n\n##### AST changes\n\nAST had a lot of changes.\n\n##### Selector\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstSelector.md)\n\n1.  Type changed: `selector` -> `Selector`.\n2.  Prop changed: `selectors` -> `rules`, also `selectors` contained `ruleSet[]`, which in turn has `rule` field,\n    and new `rules` contains `Rule[]` directly.\n\nBefore: `{type: 'selector', selectors: [ {type: 'ruleSet', rule: {<RULE 1 DATA>}}, {type: 'ruleSet', rule: {<RULE 2 DATA>}} ]}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Selector', rules: [ {<RULE 1 DATA>}, {<RULE 2 DATA>} ]}`.\n\n##### Rule\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstRule.md)\n\n1.  Type changed: `rule` -> `Rule`.\n2.  Prop changed: `id: string` -> `ids: string[]`. According to the CSS spec one rule may have more than 1 `id`,\n    so `#root#root` is a valid selector.\n3.  Prop renamed: `nestingOperator` -> `combinator`. A proper name according to CSS spec was chosen.\n4.  Prop renamed: `rule` -> `nestedRule`. A proper name to indicate nesting was chosen.\n5.  Prop changed: `tagName: string` -> `tag: TagName | WildcardTag`. Using explicit distinction between\n    TagName (i.e. `div`) and WildcardTag (`*`), because tag name can also be `*` if escaped properly (`\\*`).\n6.  Prop changed: `attrs` -> `attributes`. Attribute type was changed, see below.\n7.  Prop changed: `pseudos` -> `pseudoClasses`. There are pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, now they are separated\n    properly (there is a separate `pseudoElement` property). Pseudo class type was changed, see below.\n\nBefore:\n\n```javascript\n({\n    type: 'rule',\n    tagName: 'div',\n    id: 'user-123',\n    classNames: ['user'],\n    attrs: [\n        {name: 'role', operator: '$=', valueType: 'string', value: 'button'}\n    ],\n    pseudos: [\n        {name: 'lang', valueType: 'string', value: 'en'}\n    ],\n    nestingOperator: '>'\n})\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```javascript\n({\n    type: 'Rule',\n    tag: {type: 'TagName', name: 'div'},\n    ids: ['user-123'],\n    classNames: ['user'],\n    attributes: [\n        {type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '$=', value: {type: 'String', value: 'button'}}\n    ],\n    pseudoClasses: [\n        {type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', value: {type: 'String', value: 'en'}}\n    ],\n    combinator: '>'\n})\n```\n\n##### Attribute\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstAttribute.md)\n\n1.  Type introduced: `Attribute`.\n2.  Prop `value` and `valueType` were combined to a single prop `value` with a field `type`.\n\n[All possible value types.](docs/interfaces/AstAttribute.md#value)\n\n##### Example 1\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role'}`.\n\n##### Example 2\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role', operator: '$=', valueType: 'string', value: 'button'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '$=', value: {type: 'String', value: 'button'}}`.\n\n##### Example 3\n\nBefore: `{name: 'role', operator: '=', valueType: 'substitute', value: 'var'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'Attribute', name: 'role', operator: '=', value: {type: 'Substitute', name: 'var'}}`.\n\n##### Pseudo Classes\n\n[New type info.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoClass.md)\n\n1.  Type introduced: `PseudoClass`.\n2.  Prop `value` and `valueType` were combined to a single prop `argument` with a field `type`.\n\n[All possible argument types.](docs/interfaces/AstPseudoClass.md#argument)\n\n##### Example 1\n\nBefore: `{name: 'visited'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'visited'}`.\n\n##### Example 2\n\nBefore: `{name: 'lang', valueType: 'string', value: 'en'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', argument: {type: 'String', value: 'en'}}`.\n\n##### Example 3\n\nBefore: `{name: 'lang', valueType: 'substitute', value: 'var'}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'lang', argument: {type: 'Substitute', name: 'var'}}`.\n\n##### Example 4\n\nBefore: `{name: 'has', valueType: 'selector', value: {type: 'selector', selectors: [{type: 'ruleSet', rule: {type: 'rule', tagName: 'div'}}]}}`.\n\nAfter: `{type: 'PseudoClass', name: 'has', argument: {type: 'Selector', rules: [{type: 'Rule', tag: {type: 'TagName', name: 'div'}}]}}`.\n\n### [`v2.1.0`](https://togithub.com/mdevils/css-selector-parser/compare/0e517dc411b050964f2a291dcbe2218df9f1ef28...v2.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mdevils/css-selector-parser/compare/0e517dc411b050964f2a291dcbe2218df9f1ef28...v2.1.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Because there's no documented reason for _why_ this restriction is in place, I'm now deeming this unnecessary. Developers should not be restricted in this manner. Instead, configs that may have caused infinite redirects in the past should be updated to not be infinite. It is confusing to ignore configs with redirects after an absolute redirect occurred because it creates different matching rules depending on the whether an absolute redirect has happened or not.\r\n\r\nFor additional context on why I believe removing this restriction is\r\nnecessary, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13373 asks for allowing `redirectTo` to be a function. It\r\nwould make sense to allow this function to return a `UrlTree` like other\r\nguards in the Router. When guards in the `Router` return `UrlTree`, they\r\ncancel the current navigation and start a new one to re-do the route\r\nmatching. Since we're already in the router matching part, we don't need\r\nto cancel the navigation. However, the restriction on absolute redirects\r\nhere then creates a weird situation where developers wouldn't see any\r\nother redirects if they returned a `UrlTree` as an absolute redirect\r\nfrom `redirectTo`.\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: Absolute redirects no longer prevent further redirects.

Technically speaking this should be an anti-pattern since the ng-module could contain some runtime logic (e.g., providing something, calling some services, etc) and its not being loaded leads to unexpected behaviour. However, in many cases ng-module is an empty class and its only usage is for providing scope, and since in AoT full compilation mode we already hard-code dependencies into components so we can get away with not loading the ng-module. But in AoT local compilation mode it is not possible to get away since the component's dependencies are computed in runtime and the presence of the corresponding ng-module in the browser is needed. For this reason in this change it is forbidden to attempt to render a component without first loading its ng-module in local compilation mode and an explicit error message is created to make this situation clear. This error message can help with catching such cases when running TGP in Google.\r\n\r\nIt would be an interesting question as to whether to ban this situation in full compilation mode as well, as it is error prone and these errors are sometimes very hard to debug.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

        "body": "These changes add support for control flow in the template type checker. It works by creating native control flow statements inside the TCB which allows us to get features like type narrowing for free. For example, a template like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{#switch expr}\r\n  {:case 1} One\r\n  {:case 2} Two\r\n  {:default} Default\r\n{/switch}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be represented as the following in the TCB:\r\n```\r\nswitch (this.expr) {\r\n  case 1:\r\n    ...\r\n    break;\r\n  case 2:\r\n    ...\r\n    break;\r\n  default:\r\n    ...\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes are split up into a few commits to make them easier to review in isolation. This is an overview of commits:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for switch blocks\r\nAdds support for template type checking inside `switch` blocks. It is implemented by generating a JS `switch` statement inside the TCB which allows us to do type narrowing of the expression.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for if blocks\r\nAdds support for template type checking inside `if` blocks. It is implemented by generating a JS `if` statement inside the TCB which allows us to do type narrowing of the expression. The `as` parameter is implemented by declaring a variable inside the `if` statement.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for loop blocks\r\nAdds support for template type checking inside `for` blocks. It is implemented by generating a JS `for...of` statement inside the TCB. The various loop variables (e.g. `$index`) are implemented by declaring a local number variable.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): implement template type checking for tracking expressions\r\nAdds support for template type checking of the `track` expression of a `for` loop block. Tracking expressions are treated as any other expression for type checking, however we have some special validation that doesn't allow them to access template variables and local references.",

        "body": "Although there are several pages, only `service-worker-getting-started.md` has an example. That example code was migrated.\r\n\r\nWorked around the few references to NgModule.\r\n\r\nOther changes as follows:\r\n\r\n**Revised \"Getting Started\"**\r\n\r\nThe original service worker example page (`service-worker-getting-started.md`) is full of holes! I don\u2019t know how anyone got this working just by following this page\r\n\r\n- it doesn\u2019t tell you where to get the example (and it isn\u2019t generated by AIO)\r\n- it doesn\u2019t tell you that ng serve doesn\u2019t support service worker apps\r\n- it mentions http-server in passing but not what that is or where to get it.\r\n- several commands tell you to supply the \u201cproject-name\u201d but (a) it doesn\u2019t tell you how to find that name and (b) you never actually have to provide a name at all. That includes on the command that gets http-server going.\r\n\r\n**Hid section on `ngsw-config` tool**\r\n\r\nHid the discussion of the `ngsw-config` tool in `service-worker-config.md` because (a) the command invoke it didn't seem to work and (b) it referenced `<project-name>` without explaining what that is or where to find it.\r\n\r\nLeft the hidden text in the page in case someone wants to do something about this.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, you seem to be able to edit the `ngsw-config.json` and then rebuild. That should suffice.\r\n\r\n**Disabled E2E**\r\n\r\nThe AIO CI will no longer attempt to run the (thin) E2E tests.\r\n\r\nThese tests could lightly test the app with the dev server but couldn't test the Service Worker aspects; that would require launching the app with something other than `ng serve` and the AIO CI is not set up for that.\r\n\r\nThe existing tests appeared to pass when run locally with the dev server. However, only one of them actually ran; test runner reported. \"There were tests whose specified size is too big.\"\r\n\r\nDecided to bypass E2E testing of this project for now.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [x] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...
