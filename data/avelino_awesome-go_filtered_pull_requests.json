Divide\r\n- Improved security of html generation. use \"goquery\" to change the html, not \"strings.Replace\"\r\n- Find some issues (described in \"FIXME\" in the code. Author's solution required)\r\n- Rename \"objects\" to \"categories\" and \"elements\" to \"links\".\r\n- Break code into functions. This is useful for writing tests or making changes easily.\r\n- Test refactoring: adding test helpers and assertions\r\n- Remove panics\r\n- Close file descriptors\r\n- Do not pass cards and slices by signs\r\n- Add netlify.toml, remove _redirects\r\n",

This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by case.",
