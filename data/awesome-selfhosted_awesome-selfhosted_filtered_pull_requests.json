I would appreciate your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe current PR template can be quite dense, making it challenging to navigate through all the checks. To enhance clarity and ease of understanding, I propose categorizing the checks into smaller sections. This approach would allow for a more structured and organized PR submission process.\r\n\r\nHow this would look in an actual PR can be seen here: https://github.com/Rabenherz112/awesome-selfhosted/pull/4\r\n\r\n(I am not really happy atm with the categories yet, see this as a proof of concept.)",
