For example: if I know it takes 1 second to turn on the hose, get 1 liter of water, and turn it off, I cannot conclude that the maximum rate I can get water out of the hose is 1 liter per second (though I can conclude it's more than that). \r\n2. The throughput estimates seem suspect, in and of themselves. These are great numbers to know, of course, but need to be backed by a separate source.
