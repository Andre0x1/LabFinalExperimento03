From [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/):\r\n\r\n> You can use the chrome.action API to control the toolbar button for your extension in Chrome's UI. The action icons are displayed in the browser toolbar, to the right of the omnibox (on left-to-right devices). After installation, by default, these appear in the extensions menu (the puzzle piece). Users can choose to pin your extension icon to the toolbar.\r\n\r\nElectron has no comparable concept for the toolbar button or popup, and will never support this API. However, as of now, many extensions use it, and it throws disruptive errors that can prevent other supported aspects of a given extension from working as intended. To combat this, I'm adding stripped-down infrastructure for the API _without_ supporting it, such that it will not throw an error when `chrome.action` APIs are called but will log that the APIs are unsupported and will not work as expected. This will prevent confusing errors for users and more clearly delineate what we do and don't support.\r\n\r\nThis approach was also taken in [this PR](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/39729).\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

On an API level, When `ToastNotifier.Hide` is called, the `ToastNotification` is removed from the screen if it is currently visible, and it is _not_ sent to the Action Center. A `ToastNotification` is considered dismissed per underlying callbacks if it leaves the screen, and so our existing logic destroyed and garbage collected the underlying notification as soon as the notification left the screen _regardless_ of whether it was dismissed programmatically, by the user, or by timeout.\r\n\r\nIf it was dismissed by the user or by timeout, it entered the Action Center, and `notification.close()` then appeared to have no effect because the notification in JS-land was still alive. In order to address this problem, and ensure that the notification's behavior aligned more closely with 1) our documentation and 2) other platforms, we need to make some changes to garbage collection behavior as well as which APIs are called depending on whether the `ToastNotification` has already entered the Action Center. If it is dismissed by timeout or sent to the Action Center by the user, we want to notify the user via event, but now, we do _not_ want to immediately destroy the underlying notification. We instead want to wait until the notification is destroyed programmatically or removed from the action center to destroy the underlying `ToastNotification`. We use the `ToastNotificationHistory` class to remove it from the Action Center.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

The `EarlyMallocZoneRegistration` call is currently a no-op since PartitionAlloc is disabled in Electron.\r\n2. The prerequisite of calling `EarlyMallocZoneRegistration` is that the whole application is built as a library and the executable binary loads the app by `dlopen` and `dlsym` (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1452229 has some background information on this). Electron is currently still linking the executable binaries to the `Electron Framework` which does not match the prerequisite and will crash when  PartitionAlloc is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR will unblock https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/33981.\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: none",

Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA few different goodies here. The generic logic around creating the new release project board from our template has been pushed to [`dsanders11/project-actions`](https://github.com/dsanders11/project-actions/) where it's got full test coverage (including integration tests) and can be iterated on without needing to involve `e/e`.\r\n\r\nThe project visibility unfortunately cannot be set to public automatically due to a GitHub bug, so for now that's commented out and we'll manually make it public.\r\n\r\n#### Template Field Values\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, there's added support for setting field values on draft issues when the new release project board is created. This can be done by adding an HTML comment to the draft issue body which maps field names to field values, and is done after the normal mustache templating so the values can come from template values. No current usage, but the feature will be used in the future to automatically set the date fields on draft issues, once that data is available somewhere in machine-readable form.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- fields\r\n  {\r\n    \"Start Date\": \"2023-11-01\",\r\n    \"End Date\": \"{{ end-date }}\"\r\n  }\r\n-->\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Stable Prep Completed By\r\n\r\nAnother feature being added is support for linking pull requests to our draft issues for stable prep items using the syntax \"Completed by https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/N\", similar to GitHub's \"Closes\" syntax in pull requests. There can be multiple linked pull requests, and when they're all merged, the stable prep item will be marked as completed.\r\n\r\nThese will be checked by a workflow that runs every 12 hours, and we can adjust as needed.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

        "body": "#### Description of Change\r\nAdded instructions to bundle PipeWire library in snap packages. PipeWire is dynamically loaded by Chromium and Electron, so it has to be bundled in a snap package. However, Ubuntu does not include libpipewire in any base snap, which necessitates manually bundling the library in every package. I've also updated the base snap in the example to the newest version.\r\n\r\nI've tested the instructions using a [barebones Electron application](https://github.com/aiddya/desktop-capture-preview). I've also tested the changes in the example `snapcraft.yaml`. In my testing, `snapcraft` requires the output files to be world readable and writable and the files created by `electron-packager` are not. This is regardless of the base snap version. Once the permission issues are fixed, the changes create a valid snap package.\r\n\r\ncc @VerteDinde \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] relevant documentation, tutorials, templates and examples are changed or added\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: none",

This enables making network calls from the utility process with the full capabilities of Chromium's native networking instead of the Node.js implementation. Example benefits include system TLS certificates, system proxy settings, support for basic, digest, NTLM, Kerberos, and negotiate authentication schemes.\r\n\r\nThe current net API in the main process requires any request from the utility process to be proxied via the main process UI thread. This PR makes it that main process establishes the `URLLoaderFactory` connection with the Network service and passes the remote endpoint to the utility process allowing it make requests directly with the Network service. This is borrowed on the same principle as renderer process perform today to make network requests.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/192899\r\nCC @deepak1556 \r\n\r\n~Note: opening this with some remaining clean up work todo in order to get early feedback.~\r\n\r\n~Remaining~ Completed clean up work:\r\n- [x] Add `electron/utility` module to [docs-parser](https://github.com/electron/docs-parser) and [typescript-definitions](https://github.com/electron/typescript-definitions) repos @devm33\r\n  - https://github.com/electron/docs-parser/pull/95 \r\n  - https://github.com/electron/typescript-definitions/pull/246\r\n- [x] Clean up imports once `electron/utility` module is available @deepak1556 \r\n- [x] Implement fetch API for utility process without session hook @devm33\r\n- [x] Switch PID of `loader_params->process_id`  to use utility process pid instead of `kBrowserProcessId` @devm33\r\n- [x] Move `electron_api_net.cc` from browser to common and rename linked binding @devm33 \r\n- [x] Improve test coverage by reusing the common specs from api-net-spec.ts using a custom mocha runner for the utility process @devm33\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

        "body": "#### Description of Change\r\n\r\nThe window contents of Electron windows are marked as transparent even though neither `transparent` nor `opacity` settings are set in the `BrowserWindow` options.\r\n\r\n**Debugging DirectComposition redraws**\r\n\r\nChromium 118 has a new flag called `DCompDebugVisualization` that uses [EnableDrawRegions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dcomp/nf-dcomp-idcompositionvisualdebug-enableredrawregions) to display on the screen sections of a window that are redrawn by DirectComposition.\r\n\r\n**The problem**\r\n\r\nWith `DCompDebugVisualization`, we can notice a difference in the frequency of redraws of `<video>` elements in Chromium compared to a regular non-transparent window in Electron.\r\n\r\nWhile a video stream is rendered on screen, almost no redraws are displayed in Chromium. On Electron, a redraw is displayed for every video frame rendered.\r\n\r\nElectron Fiddle gist: https://gist.github.com/brhenrique/100fc28409508d1730fb4216268cf04a\r\n\r\n**Why it happens?**\r\n\r\nWhen the contents of the window are set to be transparent, `DirectCompositionChildSurfaceWin::SetDrawRectangle` will use `DXGI_ALPHA_MODE_PREMULTIPLIED` instead of `DXGI_ALPHA_MODE_IGNORE`. This will trigger the DC redraw for every video frame.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nIf neither `transparent` nor `opacity` settings are used with a `BrowserWindow`, it seems safe to assume the contents of the BrowserWindow won't need alpha blending with other windows. So in this PR we override `ShouldWindowContentsBeTransparent` to take into account the transparency and opacity settings of the native window.\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n_Rendering 4 480p video elements in a blank opaque non-fullscreen Electron window on a 2160p display_\r\n\r\nBefore: DWM uses 16-18% GPU\r\nAfter: DWM uses less than 1%\r\n\r\n_Rendering 4 480p video elements in a blank opaque non-fullscreen Electron window on a 1080p display_\r\n\r\nBefore: DWM uses 6-8% GPU\r\nAfter: DWM uses less than 1%\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

If `uv_loop_` is declared first, it can be a dangling `raw_ptr<>` in the destructor since classes destroy their fields in reverse order of declaration.\r\n\r\nSecondary cleanups: reduce the scope and mutability of related fields & methods by making them `const` or `private` as applicable.\r\n\r\nCC @codebytere @deepak1556 @VerteDinde who did review on previous PRs\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [x] `npm test` passes\r\n- [x] relevant documentation, tutorials, templates and examples are changed or added\r\n- [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/main/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/main/README.md#examples).\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes: none",

This was done to address an issue where `GetRenderWidgetHostView::CopyFromSurface` didn't call its callback in some occlusion cases. The original issue occurred because when a given page is hidden, the compositor called the provided callback immediately without posting it to the main thread - the worker thread then deadlocked as it tried to acquire the lock guarding the `Promise` returned by `webContents.capturePage` held by the main thread.

I think the conditional should instead be:\r\n`        while (Date.now() - start < 200 && n < 500) {` - which will limit the loop to 200ms.\r\n\r\nAlso, I re-enabled the test on all platforms to see if this resolves issues on the disabled platforms.  Linux arm/arm64 still doesn't work, but Windows 32-bit and Windows on Arm are now both enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
