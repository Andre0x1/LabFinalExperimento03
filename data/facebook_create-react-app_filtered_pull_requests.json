Found several reasons why it is so hard:\r\n  - `require` are not all in the begging of the file\r\n  - used `require.resolve` in the middle of the code\r\n\r\n## How it is solved?\r\n\r\n1. refactor the code and move all require on top of the file\r\n2. sorting and categorization of the dependencies (comments that divide requires by logic)\r\n3. refactor `require.resolve` to a call of arrow function, arrow functions declared on top of the file\r\n",

So we can reach our project on `http://localhost:3000`, but **only over IPv4**!\n\nFor browsers this isn't really a problem, as they fall back to IPv4 automatically. But other clients usually don't have such a fallback, and as more operating systems/frameworks will default to IPv6, this will cause problems.\n\nBy using `::` instead of `0.0.0.0`, the server will be available on both IPv4 and IPv6 by default.\n\nI've tested this change locally, and the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/net.html#serverlistenoptions-callback) mention that dual-stack support is the default behaviour when using `::`. But more testing might be needed.\n\n----\n\nA little more context: I ran into this issue because I'm using `setupProxy` to access my GraphQL API through the `devServer`. So I ran `graphql-codegen` against `http://localhost:3000/graphql`, and it tries to connect using IPv6.\n",

In codebases with ESM libraries shared between Node and the frontend, this is the recommended module resolution for native ESM.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, setting the `node16` module resolution currently breaks `create-react-app`. The reason is that imports need an explicit extension, and TypeScript requires to use the _output_ module for resolution; even for bundlers. So `foo.ts` must be imported as `foo.js`.\r\n\r\nTo support this use case, [Webpack 5.74.0](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.74.0) introduced the `extensionAlias` option. This commit updates the Webpack config used by `react-scripts` to use this new option and fix support for `node16` module resolution in TypeScript.\r\n\r\nCloses facebook/create-react-app#12625\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

Dev Server has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema. options.allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string.`\r\n\r\nAfter applying this patch, the script will run as expected, setting the `allowedHost` property of the Webpack config to the given hostname.\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n\r\nThe function [`createDevServerConfig`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/d960b9e38c062584ff6cfb1a70e1512509a966e7/packages/react-scripts/config/webpackDevServer.config.js#L24) expects the hostname as string for its second argument, but instead of `HOST`, `urls.lanUrlForConfig` is provided and its value is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nIt appears, this bug has been in introduced all the way back in [2017](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/commit/8dc9217b61d8a2464fc6e5fdd5b1af925d572e02).",

        "body": "**This solution is incomplete - it will unfortunately need to touch a many more places in several packages to work in all cases.**\r\n\r\nWebPack 5 includes support for [automatically determining the public path](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/#automatic-publicpath) by passing `publicPath='auto'`.  This change adds support for `PUBLIC_URL=\"auto\"` or for including `\"homepage\" = \"auto\"` in `package.json`.  When \"auto\" is specified, webpack is configured with `publicPath='auto'` and the resulting webpack build will automatically determine the base path on load.\r\n\r\nThis is useful when the root path is not known at build time.  It has been possible to specify `PUBLIC_URL=.` which correctly resolves most resources relative to the root `index.html` - however, in some cases (for example when launching a WebWorker) this causes issues when a script attempts to reference another script with a path relative to the base path - with `PUBLIC_URL=.` the second script resolves to a path *relative to the first script* rather than relative to `index.html`.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth considering making \"auto\" the default public path value (instead of \"/\") when neither `homepage` nor `PUBLIC_URL` are specified.  This should be a non-breaking change (and should reduce the need for specifying this configuration at all) but I opted for leaving it out of this change to keep the surface area small.  I would suggest that after this has been used as an opt-in configuration for some time it could be promoted to the default in a future release of Create React App.\r\n\r\nThis allows `PUBLIC_URL=auto` as a workaround solution for #12503",

        "body": "Added support for alternative tsconfig through TSCONFIG_BUILD env variable.\r\nIt's intended for using a custom tsconfig in a monorepo setting.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTSCONFIG_BUILD=tsconfig.build.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact-scripts doesn't play with path aliases. But in monorepos a lot of people go a long way to have them.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is to have a tsconfig.json that inherits a base tsconfig with all internal package folders defined in order to facilitate easy navigation from the outermost projects into components inside library projects. But by doing that it causes the build process to navigate through the source files instead of the build/dist folders of the library project builds. This is usually solved by updating the tsconfig on the fly before react-scripts build or copying between build and edit mode configs.\r\nThis PR gives the possibility for react-scripts to use a dedicated tsconfig.build.json instead of the tsconfig.json used by the editor.\r\n\r\n_This is version 2 of [this PR](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/11031) (which is incorrectly marked as merged and almost the same diff is available [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/compare/main...CarlRibbegaardh:create-react-app:until-pr))_\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a super simple sample to show how it works. It's the turborepo \"with-create-react-app\" that originally suffers from not being able to navigate to the components through CTRL-Click in VSCode. You can try out that behavior in /apps/doc/App.tsx and navigate to Link and compare with /apps/web/App.tsx. The difference is that the latter has a specific build tsconfig that is working as create-react-app expects.\r\n\r\nSample:\r\nhttps://github.com/CarlRibbegaardh/turborepo/tree/tsconfig-build-sample/examples/with-create-react-app\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/turborepo/compare/main...CarlRibbegaardh:turborepo:tsconfig-build-sample\r\n\r\nThings to try:\r\n1 build whole project: yarn build\r\n2 cd ./apps/web\r\n3 yarn build\r\n4 rename ./apps/web/tsconfig.json to something invalid and yarn build inside that folder again\r\n5 go to Link.tsx and make the file content invalid, then yarn build from apps\\web (should still work since dist/index.js is used) (building from top would rebuild ui first \r\n6 building from top will of course trigger build errors as usual\r\n\r\nTo compare with how similar situations are solved by ejecting or craco, google search for:\r\nyarn workspaces create react app\r\ncreate react app path alias\r\n\r\n",

Making them relative to the `rootDir` solves any issues.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3789226/179768781-0ed5dcbc-4e69-4e1d-baad-00f7ca77d2bc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3789226/179767619-82e7f1eb-e2d7-42b2-8c8e-a059b36889b1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

According to webpack docs found [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/ecma-script-modules/#flagging-modules-as-esm) to force the module type of a file you can use the .cjs extension similarly to .mjs for ESM. Without this extension explicitly added to the loader test rule, packages using .cjs file as a `main` in there package.json will not work at all. The index.cjs file is picked up by the file loader and treated as an asset. A good example of this behavior are all prosemirror packages witch are not usable in CRA app.\n\nI tested my changes on a the codebase of a relatively complex project I am working on and the change is not breaking anything so far.

        "body": "At my company, we're trying to create a UI Component library. It imports SVGs and font files, and we'd like for its use to require no configuration. Thus, we're shipping code like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-import iconUrl from \"./icon.svg\" // Syntax A. Requires a bundler + config\r\n+const iconUrl = new URL(\"./icon.svg\", import.meta.url).href // Syntax B. Requires no bundler or config\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is well-supported in runtimes ([caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_statements_import_meta)), and bundlers (e.g.: [webpack 5+](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/), [parcel 2+](https://parceljs.org/languages/javascript/#url-dependencies), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#new-url-url-import-meta-url), [Next.js 11+](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5)). This construct is supposed to return a URL to the asset.\r\n\r\nHowever, `react-scripts`'s Webpack configuration adds SVGr to every SVG import, Syntax A or B, which breaks the assumptions of libraries that expect the URL to point to a raw asset (in our case, an SVG file) and instead get a URL to SVGr'd JS file.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a [Webpack rule option](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/#:~:text=To%20exclude%20assets%20that%20came%20from%20new%20URL%20calls%20from%20the%20asset%20loaders) to disable SVGr in SVG files imported through `new URL(\"./file.svg\", import.meta.url)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n1. Run `create-react-app` and create a new app.\r\n\r\n2. Change the following in `src/App.js`:\r\n\r\n   ```diff\r\n   -import logo from './logo.svg';\r\n    import './App.css';\r\n   \r\n   +const logo = new URL(\"./logo.svg\", import.meta.url).href;\r\n   +\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Run the app through `start`\r\n\r\nThe result is as follows:\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511681/171619866-0cb8141d-7643-43b8-8341-3b7ebfddc8bd.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511681/171622540-447b73f5-d235-4113-923b-2100f57bc2ed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this patch:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/511681/171619699-d720e7d4-1777-49ec-b400-aa6fbe764d17.png)\r\n",

That's why reverting to the default font size that docusaurus provides. It looks better to me that way.\r\n- **Use GitHub icon in navbar instead of text:** Replaced the top right side GitHub text with GitHub icon. Supports dark mode too.\r\n- **Move navbar items to left side:** Moved the navbar items: `Docs` and `Help` to the left side following docusaurus website.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n\r\nhttps://arifszn.github.io/create-react-app\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Previous\r\n\r\n![Screenshot (337)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45073703/168479478-f7984eb1-d940-48c8-aea9-fc348c609224.png)\r\n \r\n### Updated\r\n\r\n![Screenshot (339)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45073703/168479487-67cdbb04-17f9-4e68-a3c9-9b9ab50945e0.png)\r\n\r\n",

Micro-frontends are becoming a more prevalent form of UI development for the enterprise environment. We love what create-react-app provides, but in order to get it working at the moment, we rely on these forked changes. Hopefully this PR has what you're looking for, if not I'm happy to make additional accommodations and open to suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Changes\r\n* Add a new optional `setupModuleFederation.js` file that manages the webpack Module Federation plugin\r\n* When the `setupModuleFederation.js` file is present, use the Module Federation plugin\r\n* Since Micro-frontend apps do not typically have their own index.html (unless they're using iframes), the index.html file along with the `public` folder are now optional.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n1. Execute the following bash script which performs the following:\r\n    * Initializes a new CRA mfe app repo\r\n    * Clones down and installs the forked repo\r\n    * Installs local `react-scripts` from forked repo\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn create react-app mfe-app && \\\r\ngit clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/create-react-app.git && \\\r\nyarn --cwd=\"./create-react-app\" && \\\r\nyarn --cwd=\"./mfe-app\" add file:../create-react-app/packages/react-scripts\r\n```\r\n### Negative Test\r\n1. In the `mfe-app` repo, run `yarn start`\r\n2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/webpack-dev-server` and note the files listed appear as normal\r\n\r\n### Positive Test\r\n1. Create a `src/setupModuleFederation.js` file with the following contents:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  name: 'test',\r\n  library: { type: 'var', name: 'test' },\r\n  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',\r\n  exposes: { '.': './src/App.js' }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Navigate to the `mfe-app` repo\r\n3. Delete the `public/index.html` file (optional)\r\n4. Run `yarn start`\r\n5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/webpack-dev-server` and notice the `remoteEntry.js` file\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nWebpack served assets:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"966\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8533429/163050452-3ab16359-4257-4bb7-a031-f44bc95f2104.png\">\r\n\r\n`remoteEntry.js` file:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"831\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8533429/163050528-966ece55-ce67-4892-9476-3ebb8b37e924.png\">\r\n",

I manually tested this change on a local create-react-app project to verify that CJS files are now processed as javascript.

So this allows developers who use this to get a more fine grain result for their end users with a better error message.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

The browser name could change based on OS or linux distro.\r\n* Start the template project with `npm run start`. A new tab should open in the specified browser.\r\n* Stop the process and remove the newly created `.env` file.\r\n* Start again the project with `npm run start`: it should open on the default browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
