The reference MSVC build has less strict warnings, which can be a problem for MSVC users building at higher warning levels (e.g. React Native for Windows in OSS uses `/W4` as its baseline warning level).\n\nThis bumps up the MSVC warning level to `/W4`, since we are nearly clean already.\n\nThere are some limitations. E.g. we don't test binary with MSVC (some issues I didn't work out), and only test building statically linked. But but we do have a minimal C benchmark we compile with MSVC.\n\nX-link: https://github.com/facebook/yoga/pull/1432\n\nDifferential Revision: D50398443\n\nPulled By: NickGerleman\n\n\n",

        "body": "Summary:\nBefore resolving https://github.com/facebook/yoga/issues/1208 yoga was in a state where \"leading\" and \"trailing\" only referred to the main-start and main-end directions ([definition in spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox/#box-model)). That is, the start/end of the layout of flex items in a container. This is distinct from something like inline-start/inline-end which is the [start of text layout as defined by direction](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-3/#inline-start).\n\nThe bug linked above happened because \"leading\" and \"trailing\" functions are referring to the wrong directions in certain cases. So in order to fix this we added a new set of functions to get the \"leading\" and \"trailing\" edges according to what inline-start/inline-end would refer to - i.e. those defined by the direction (ltr | rtl). In this state I think it is confusing to understand which function refers to which direction and more specific names could help that.\n\nThis diff just renames the following 4 FlexDirection.h functions:\n\n* **leadingEdge** -> **flexStartEdge**\n* **trailingEdge** -> **flexEndEdge**\n* **leadingLayoutEdge** -> **inlineStartEdge**\n* **trailingLayoutEdge** -> **inlineEndEdge**\n\nThe spec calls the start/end directions as dictated by the flex-direction attribute \"main-start\" and \"main-end\" respectively, but mainStartEdge might be a bit confusing given it will be compared to a non-flexbox-specific name in inlineStartEdge. As a result I landed on flexStart/flexEnd similar to what values are used with alignment attributes (justify-content, align-content).\n\nI chose to get rid of the \"leading\" and \"trailing\" descriptors to be more in line with what terminology the spec uses.\n\nNext diff will be to rename the functions in Node.cpp to adhere to the above patterns.\n\nDifferential Revision: D50342254\n\n\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nThe current ReactModalHostView implementation incorrectly applies system bar appearances by providing the wrong mask to the `setSystemBarsAppearance` method invocation. Per [this issue comment](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/34350#issuecomment-1760339877), @jaydonlau correctly identified that when the status bar is set to `light-content` (light icons, dark background), the function is called with both a `0` appearance and `0` mask, which should instead be provided with the `APPEARANCE_LIGHT_STATUS_BARS` mask. \r\n\r\nThe first pass at this PR attempted to pull out the entire appearance from the activity, compare it against the dialog's appearance, and only use a mask of differing bits (see the `appearanceMask` variable). However, if the `android:windowLightStatusBar` attribute is ever set to true, this does not impact the appearance of the status bar but rather the system UI visibility. As a result, the derived mask from system bars appearance would be 0 since both the activity and dialog would have appearances of 0.\r\n\r\nRather than try and \"future-proof\" this implementation for other uses of system bar appearance, this change is directed only at updating the `APPEARANCE_LIGHT_STATUS_BARS` bit in the dialog's system bar appearance. The only other native code that touches status bars is the `StatusBarModule` and that only touches this flag. \r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #34899.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.\r\n\r\nPick one each for the category and type tags:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID|GENERAL|IOS|INTERNAL] [BREAKING|ADDED|CHANGED|DEPRECATED|REMOVED|FIXED|SECURITY] - Message\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\nhttps://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[ANDROID] [FIXED] - Fixed an issue where the status bar colors would not match when opening modals\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid.

It also, at least in the sample activity I tried, gives us the Window's `LayoutParams`.\r\n2. The root of the hierarchy is documented in code to do what we want. https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/94972039571e1f3b387e0f63227a6ad13740eaf3\r\n3. Calling `getRootView().getLayoutParams()`, then casting to `WindowManager.LayoutParams`, seems to show up in a lot of other widgets (inc Unity, RoboElectric), as a solution to getting this information. https://github.com/search?q=getRootView%28%29.getLayoutParams%28%29&type=code\r\n\r\nThis still feels like not a 100% documented contract, so I added an assertion so we can catch if the contract isn't valid somewhere now or in the future, instead of silently breaking keyboard events.\r\n\r\nNote that this code only runs on SDK 30+ (Android 11+).\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nOn Android API 34 emulator, set an explicit `windowSoftInputMode` for `RNTesterActivity` and check the keyboard events page run via ` buck install rntester-android`.\r\n\r\n| `adjustResize` (RN default) | `adjustPan` | `adjustNothing` |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| ![image](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/835219/394f08e5-aec1-4729-a5cb-52e1b906edab) |  ![image](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/835219/8a787fb8-701b-4840-b4d6-4045006cba3c) | ![image](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/835219/3e952557-8bbb-42ce-8dd4-3c3a294c146c) |\r\n\r\nDifferential Revision: D50297761\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Summary:\n## Summary\n\nThis creates a new version of `RuntimeScheduler` that's intended to be backwards compatible but with a few notable changes:\n1. `scheduleTask` is now thread-safe.\n2. `scheduleWork` is now just an alias of `scheduleTask` with immediate priority (to preserve the yielding semantics it had over other tasks).\n3. Yielding mechanism has changed, to make lower priority tasks to yield to higher priority tasks, instead of just yielding to `scheduleWork` and `executeNowOnTheSameThread`.\n\nWe don't expect this to have any impact in performance or user perceivable behavior, so we consider it a short-lived refactor. When we validate this assumptions in a complex application we'll delete the old version and only keep the fork.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe main motivation for this refactor is to reduce the amount of unnecessary interruptions of running tasks (via `shouldYield`) that are only used to schedule asynchronous tasks from native.\n\nThe `scheduleWork` method is the only available mechanism exposed to native APIs to schedule work in the JS thread (as the existing version of `scheduleTask` is only meant to be called from JS). This mechanism **always** asks for any running tasks in the scheduler to yield, so these tasks are always considered to have the highest priority. This makes sense for discrete user events, but not for many other use cases coming from native (e.g.: notifying network responses could be UserBlocking, Normal or Low depending on the use case).\n\nWe need a way to schedule tasks from native with other kinds of priorities, so we don't always have to interrupt what's currently executing if it has a higher priority than what we're scheduling.\n\n## Changes\n\n**General APIs:**\n\nThis centralizes scheduling in only 2 APIs in `RuntimeScheduler` (which already exist in the legacy version):\n* `scheduleTask`, which is non-blocking for the caller and can be used from any thread. This always uses the task queue in the scheduler and a new yielding mechanism.\n* `executeNowOnTheSameThread`, which is blocking for the caller and asks any task executing in the scheduler to yield. These tasks don't go through the task queue and instead queue through the existing synchronization mechanism in `RuntimeExecutor`. The yielding mechanism for these tasks is preserved.\n\n`scheduleWork` will be deprecated and it's just an alias for `scheduleTask` with an immediate priority (to preserve a similar behavior).\n\n**Yielding behavior:**\n\nBefore, tasks would only yield to tasks scheduled via `scheduleWork` and `executeNowOnTheSameThread` (those tasks didn't go through the task queue).\n\nWith this implementation, tasks would now yield to any task that has a higher position in the task queue. That means we reuse the existing mechanism to avoid lower priority tasks to never execute because higher priority tasks never stop coming.\n\nAll tasks would yield to requests for synchronous access (via `executeNowOnTheSameThread`) as did the current implementation.\n\nChangelog: [internal]\n\nDifferential Revision: D49316881\n\n",

When both are used at the same time, the array mDrawingOrderIndices in ViewGroupDrawingOrderHelper that records the rendering order of subviews is not reset when super is called in the updateSubviewClipStatus method to add and remove subviews.\r\n\r\nSolution:\u2028Because there are many third-party components that inherit from or depend on ReactViewGroup, all methods for adding and removing subviews in ViewGroup need to be override in ReactViewGroup, and ViewGroupDrawingOrderHelper corresponding to handleAddView and handleRemoveView needs to be called in these methods. And all the precautions for directly calling super to add and remove subviews are changed to calling the overridden method by ReactViewGroup. \r\n\r\nSpecial Note: All addView related methods in ViewGroup will eventually be called to the addView(View child, int index, LayoutParams params) method, except addViewInLayout. Regarding the method of adding subviews, we only need to override  addView(View child, int index, LayoutParams params) and addViewInLayout(View child, int index, LayoutParams params,boolean preventRequestLayout) in ReactViewGroup.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n[Android] [Fixed] - Fix the crash in ReactViewGroup of https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/30785",

        "body": "Summary:\nThis stack is ultimately aiming to solve https://github.com/facebook/yoga/issues/1208\n\n**The problem**\nTurns out that we do not even check direction when determining which edge is the leading (start) and trailing (end) edges. This is not how web does it as the start/end is based on the writing direction NOT the flex direction: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox#start_and_end_lines. While web does not have marginStart and marginEnd, they do have margin-inline-start/end which relies on the writing mode to determine the \"start\"/\"end\": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-inline-start.\n\nThis means that if you do something like\n```\nexport default function Playground(props: Props): React.Node {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <View style={styles.item} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    marginEnd: 100,\n    flexDirection: 'row-reverse',\n    backgroundColor: 'red',\n    display: 'flex',\n    width: 100,\n    height: 100,\n  },\n  item: {\n    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n    width: 10,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou get  {F1116264350}\nAs you can see the margin gets applied to the left edge even thought the direction is ltr and it should be applied to the right edge.\n\n**The solution**\nI ended up fixing this by creating a new `leadingLayoutEdge` and `trailingLayoutEdge` function that take the flex direction as well as the direction. Based on the errata, the a few functions will use these new functions to determine which `YGEdge` is the starting/ending.\n\nYou might be wondering why I did not put this logic inside of `leadingEdge(flexDirection)` / `trailingEdge(flexDirection)` since other areas could potentially have the same bug like `getLeadingPadding`. These functions are a bit overloaded and there are cases where we actually want to use the flexDirection to get the edge in question. For example, many of the calls to `setLayoutPosition` in `CalculateLayout.cpp` call `leadingEdge()` / `trailingEdge()` to set the proper position for cases like row-reverse where items need to line up in a different direction.\n\nDifferential Revision: D50140503\n\n",

The latter now hard-swaps between the Flipper and new launch flows.\n    - Removes now-unused switching of `devtoolsFrontendUrl`.\n- Implements `deprecated_openFlipperMiddleware` (matching previous RN CLI implementation).\n- Disables \"`j` to debug\" key handler by default.\n- Marks \"`j` to debug\" and `/open-debugger` console logs as experimental.\n\nChangelog:\n[Changed][General] Gate new debugger frontend behind `--experimental-debugger-frontend` flag, restore Flipper as base launch flow\n\nDifferential Revision: D50084590\n\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nThis PR builds upon the previous work done in https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/36925, which introduced native stack traces to the JSError for synchronous functions.\r\n\r\nThe current modifications concentrate on functions that return Promises. Prior to this PR, errors within Promise-returning functions would be thrown at the platform layer crashing the app without a link to the JS stack.\r\n\r\nAfter the implementation of this PR, errors thrown within Promise-returning functions are now captured and transformed into rejected Promises. These rejected Promises contain a JS Error object that contains both the JS stack trace and the cause, along with the platform stack trace.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR ensures that rejections from native functions are now linked to the JS stack trace, providing a more comprehensive view of the rejection flow.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.\r\n\r\nPick one each for the category and type tags:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID|GENERAL|IOS|INTERNAL] [BREAKING|ADDED|CHANGED|DEPRECATED|REMOVED|FIXED|SECURITY] - Message\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\nhttps://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[GENERAL][ADDED] - Turbo Modules Promise-returning functions reject with JS and platform stack traces information\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid.

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the leftmost characters of the TextInput element are hidden in native Android if the text is longer than the screen size.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when the value exceeds the width of the TextInput, the cursor moves to the end of the line and the first part of the text is hidden.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is caused by the `Editable.replace()`  used to update text inside `ReactEditText`. This method involves replacing a specific range of text with new text provided by us. If the current selection (cursor) is in or near the range being replaced, Android typically moves the cursor to the end of the replaced text.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the cursor position remains at the beginning of the text during the initial rendering, we can achieve this by using `EditText.setText()` when initially creating the EditText.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `isInitialRender` flag, which allows the EditText.setText method to be called when the EditText is initially created.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n[ANDROID] [Fixed] - cursor position for overflowed text on Android TextInput\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPick one each for the category and type tags:\r\n\r\n\r\n[ANDROID|GENERAL|IOS|INTERNAL] [BREAKING|ADDED|CHANGED|DEPRECATED|REMOVED|FIXED|SECURITY] - Message\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\nhttps://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid.

Using a collection which does retain/release seems to cause a crash due to double release or similar, so those semantics seem intentional (though I'm not super familiar with the model here).\n\nWe can replicate the memory semantics with ordering by using `NSPointerArray` (which is unfortunately not parameterized). This change does that, so we get consistently top-down layout events (matching Fabric, and Android Paper as of D49627996). This lets us use multiple layout events to calculate right/bottom edge insets deterministically.\n\nChangelog:\n[iOS][Changed] -  Deterministic onLayout event ordering for iOS Paper\n\nDifferential Revision: D50093411\n\n\n",

The concept is needed there for e.g. for `native-stack`, with the same use case as on `iOS`, where we want to know that the views will be removed to start transition on them, and we need to know it before they are removed (and it is done in a bottom-up manner on new arch).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation uses `UIManagerModule` as the place where the listeners live, since it is possible to get to this module both from this code and from library's code. All the mutations are first added to an array, then the listeners are fired, and the changes are applied afterwards.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.\r\n\r\nPick one each for the category and type tags:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID|GENERAL|IOS|INTERNAL] [BREAKING|ADDED|CHANGED|DEPRECATED|REMOVED|FIXED|SECURITY] - Message\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\nhttps://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[ANDROID] [ADDED] - Listener for view mutations\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid.

The [RCTBridge](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/[916531b9bf7a9943036807f7563c925b4c3e0101]/xplat/js/react-native-github/packages/react-native/React/Base/RCTBridge.h?lines=87-238) interface is quite big. All the props and method should be part of the protocol.\n2. Extensions declared on RCTBridge would not have worked. For example, [`RCTBridge (RCTUIManager)`](https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/[916531b9bf7a9943036807f7563c925b4c3e0101]/xplat/js/react-native-github/packages/react-native/React/Modules/RCTUIManager.h?lines=170-174).\n3. It would require a major overhaul of the APIs, returning `id<RCTBridging>` in place of **every** function that takes/return an instance of `RCTBridge *`.\n\nClearly, not a feasible way to go.\n\nDifferential Revision: D50079929\n\n\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nThis pr fixed the problem that can be reproduced with the [snack](https://snack.expo.dev/fl5DSrLBJ) on Xiaomi devices with MIUI13 and MIUI14. The problem is shown as the image below: the number \"999\" is cut off and only \"99\" is rendered.\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/23273745/64269ced-4060-4ab5-8233-8199e4f2acbd\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"text-cutoff-when-scaling-miui14\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is produced with setting font scaling in system settings like the image below shows.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/23273745/c31d1bf2-d038-4536-b1a4-509050f2aa7c\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"settings\" /> \r\n\r\nThis text cut off case can be avoided by setting [`allowFontScaling`](https://reactnative.cn/docs/text#allowfontscaling) to false. But this pr can make it no matter what value `allowFontScaling` is set.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this case, according to MIUI developers, is that Misans typeface, as a variable font which will adjust the weight of different font axes with different font size, gets different widths when Text is measured and drawn for a bug in the framework of MIUI rom. They will fix this bug in next version while this pr fixed it in old versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID][FIXED]-Fix Text cut off issues when adjusting text size and font weight in system settings.\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.\r\n\r\nPick one each for the category and type tags:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID|GENERAL|IOS|INTERNAL] [BREAKING|ADDED|CHANGED|DEPRECATED|REMOVED|FIXED|SECURITY] - Message\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\nhttps://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\nThe effect after fixed is shown in the image below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/23273745/1f93f47f-5cdf-4ee1-934a-6cb3b04309ea\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"fixed\" />\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid.

But it is not robust, because this may change with new Xcode releases.\n\n**The new solution**\nWe clear the entire environment and only define `SDKROOT`.

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nThis pr fixed the problem that can be reproduced with the [snack](https://snack.expo.dev/fl5DSrLBJ) on Xiaomi devices with MIUI13 and MIUI14. The problem is shown as the image below: the number \"999\" is cut off and only \"99\" is rendered.\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/23273745/64269ced-4060-4ab5-8233-8199e4f2acbd\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"text-cutoff-when-scaling-miui14\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is produced with setting font scaling in system settings like the image below shows.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/23273745/c31d1bf2-d038-4536-b1a4-509050f2aa7c\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"settings\" /> \r\n\r\nThis text cut off case can be avoided by setting [`allowFontScaling`](https://reactnative.cn/docs/text#allowfontscaling) to false. But this pr can make it no matter what value `allowFontScaling` is set.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this case, according to MIUI developers, is that Misans typeface, as a variable font which will adjust the weight of different font axes with different font size, gets different widths when Text is measured and drawn for a bug in the framework of MIUI rom. They will fix this bug in next version while this pr fixed it in old versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID][FIXED]-Fix Text cut off issues when adjusting text size and font weight in system settings.\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.\r\n\r\nPick one each for the category and type tags:\r\n\r\n[ANDROID|GENERAL|IOS|INTERNAL] [BREAKING|ADDED|CHANGED|DEPRECATED|REMOVED|FIXED|SECURITY] - Message\r\n\r\nFor more details, see:\r\nhttps://reactnative.dev/contributing/changelogs-in-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\nThe effect after fixed is shown in the image below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/23273745/1f93f47f-5cdf-4ee1-934a-6cb3b04309ea\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\" alt=\"fixed\" />\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid.

        "body": "Summary:\nThis change hides away most usages of YGDimension as an index. We do this for a couple reasons:\n\n1. Right now the style interface may return a full array of resolved edge or dimension values, as a CompactValue. As we abstract away from CompactValue, and move towards ValuePool, this will no longer be the internal interface, and cheap to return. We instead change the interface to return a single value at once, which lets us resolve values lazily.\n\n2. As we move internal usage to scoped enums, enums are not implicitly convertible to intergers (broadly a good thing). Hiding the enum as index prevents the need for callers to cast or convert to underlying.\n\nInstead of making a new version of `IdxRef` for this, I converted to a more traditional setter. I will be making similar changes later for other styles, when I hide CompactValue from the public interface.\n\nTo review I would recommend filtering to changes in `xplat`, or viewing this in a single one of the OSS PRs exported. Everything apart from the below 20 files is a mirror.\n\n{F1096792573}\n\nChangelog: [Internal]\n\nReviewed By: javache\n\nDifferential Revision: D49362819\n\n\n",

The change from `mv` to `cp -R` makes this script more expensive, which will make Android builds via Gradle take slightly longer.

In https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/fb30fcaa2f526cc1f7c2d4189ec9c57f9cf9b3c5, I removed a bunch of the macros that were no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, `__IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED` / `__IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED` are only defined in the iOS SDK, not the macOS SDK \ud83e\udd26. Let's extend the macro to also be defined on macOS using the macOS equivalent checks. While we're here, let's also only use the `*_MAX_ALLOWED` macros instead of `*_MIN_REQUIRED` since that's what we're actually checking against.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n\r\n[IOS] [FIXED] - Extend compile time _JSC_HAS_INSPECTABLE check to macOS\r\n\r\n## Test Plan:\r\n\r\nBuilt RN-Tester and RN-Tester-macOS and verified both show up in Safari Web Inspectors' debug menu:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1316\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10 48 43\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/6722175/c642e6e0-36af-4c9f-845a-7e491489f419\">\r\n\r\nmacOS screenshot small bc I got some internal stuff I gotta crop \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\n<img width=\"347\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 10 53 46\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/assets/6722175/1e802c88-02b8-49e1-8fd2-d91726ca1e93\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
