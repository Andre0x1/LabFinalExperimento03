        "body": "Now that we no longer support Server Context, we can now deduplicate objects. It's not completely safe for useId but only in the same way as it's not safe if you reuse elements on the client, so it's not a new issue.\r\n\r\nThis also solves cyclic object references.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that we prefer to inline objects into a plain JSON format when an object is not going to get reused. In this case the object doesn't have an id. We could potentially serialize a reference to an existing model + a path to it but it bloats the format and complicates the client.\r\n\r\nIn a smarter flush phase like we have in Fizz we could choose to inline or outline depending on what we've discovered so far before a flush. We can't do that here since we use native stringify. However, even in that solution you might not know that you're going to discover the same object later so it's not perfect deduping anyway.\r\n\r\nInstead, I use a heuristic where I mark previously seen objects and if I ever see that object again, then I'll outline it. The idea is that most objects are just going to be emitted once and if it's more than once it's fairly likely you have a shared reference to it somewhere and it might be more than two.\r\n\r\nThe third object gets deduplicated (or \"detriplicated\").\r\n\r\nIt's not a perfect heuristic because when we write the second object we will have already visited all the nested objects inside of it, which causes us to outline every nested object too even those weren't reference more than by that parent. Not sure how to solve for that.\r\n\r\nIf we for some other reason outline an object such as if it suspends, then it's truly deduplicated since it already has an id.",

This was even more egregious with fallbacks where if you rendered a hoistable in a fallback it would flush even if the suspense boundary never actually flushed the fallback because the primary content finished in time.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the flushing semantics of Hoistable Elements to bring them in line with the client.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that Hoistables are no longer an avenue to emit things like early preloads because if you do so within a Suspense Boundary the preload won't flush until the boundary completes making the preload likely not very useful. The general idea here is that Hoistables are not meant for things that have support in the imperative Float methods like `ReactDOM.preload` and `ReactDOM.preinit`. Given this we are going to simplify the flushing queue ordering to not prioritized any particular hoistables over others.\r\n\r\nThis PR however does not yet go all the way to a single queue for hoistables. First we have to deal with `charset`. Our plan is to make this a config or infer it from some encoding parameter passed to the render function. This generally is a better way to model charset since you can't reasonably emit this one late, it's either up front or broken and it's tied to some other aspect of the rendering namely the encoding format (note that for web API environments this may be limited to utf-8 only since TextEncoder can't encode other formats)\r\n\r\nThis PR also does not remove the privileged flushing for `viewport` meta tags. This is harder than charset b/c it is reasonably something you (or at least your meta-framework) might render and not know up front when you invoke the render method. If Hoistables have no privileged flushing queues then we need some means to support viewport from the imperative float methods since it emitting first before we flush things like image preloads is necessary for good performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactors the Resource tracking to follow the patterns established for task local state values. This is a cleaner implementation though not functionally different. The reason this was not originally pursued is the boundary resources at one point were entanged with the Float imperative methods so it needed to be part of the resolvable resources object during dispatch. We've moved away from that by allowing these methods to be called outside of Render and no longer associate anyting to the Boundary state itself so we can not clean up the implementation here a bit.",

        "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule that forbids the dependencies argument from being `undefined`. It triggers the error that the dependency list is not an array literal. This makes sense in pre ES5 strict-mode environments as undefined could be redefined, but should not be a concern in today's JS environments.\r\n\r\n**Justification:**\r\n* The deps argument being undefined (for `useEffect` calls etc.) is a valid use case for hooks that should re-run on every render.\r\n* The deps argument being omitted is considered a valid use case by the `exhaustive-deps` rule already.\r\n* The TypeScript type definitions support passing `undefined` because hooks are typed as `useEffect(effect: EffectCallback, deps?: DependencyList): void;`.\r\n* Since omitting an argument and passing `undefined` are considered equivalent, this eslint rule should consider them as equivalent too.\r\n\r\nFurther, I accidentally forgot passing a dependency array to `useEffect` in code that I shared on Twitter, and people started abusing me about it. I'd like to create an eslint rule for my projects that requires me to provide a dep argument in all cases (`undefined`, `[]` or the list of dependencies) so that I can avoid such problems in the future. This would also force me to always think about the dependencies instead of accidentally forgetting them and my hook running on each render. In an audit of my own codebase I had about 3% of hooks that I want to run on each render, and adding an explicit `undefined` seems reasonable in those situations.\r\n\r\nIt could be argued this could be an option or part of the `exhaustive-deps` rule, but it's probably better to merge this PR, make a release and see if my custom eslint rule gains traction in the future.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n* Added a test.\r\n* `yarn test ESLintRuleExhaustiveDeps-test`\r\n* Careful code inspection.",

However when server rendering we have no choice but to serialize props as attributes.

There was a bug however in the implementation which caused children more complex than a single string to be omitted because it matched the object type filter.

I also renamed this variable (from subtreeLanes to entangledRenderLanes) to better reflect how it's used.\r\n\r\nMy primary motivation is related to useDeferredValue, which I'll address in a later PR.",

This is currently exaggerated by frameworks because the logs on the server aren't visible enough. Even so, it's possible to do a mistake without testing it in DEV or just testing a conditional branch. That might have security implications if that object wasn't supposed to be passed.\r\n\r\nWe can't rely on only checking if the prototype is `Object.prototype` because that wouldn't work with cross-realm objects which is unfortunate. However, if it isn't, we can check wether it has exactly one prototype on the chain which would catch the common error of passing a class instance.",

Once that render finishes, it will spawn an additional render to switch to finalValue.\r\n\r\nThis same sequence should occur whenever the hook is hidden and revealed again, i.e. by a Suspense or Activity, though this part is not yet implemented.\r\n\r\nWhen initialValue is not provided, useDeferredValue has no effect during initial render, but during an update, it will remain on the previous value, then spawn an additional render to switch to the new value.

If user switches tabs, extension's service worker can be killed by browser and this polling will start spamming errors.\r\n\r\nWhat I've missed is that we also have a separate call for this API, but which is executed only once when user selects an element. We don't handle promise rejection here and this can lead to some errors when user selects an element and switches tabs right after it.\r\n\r\nThe only change here is that this API now has `shouldListenToPauseEvents` param, which is `true` for polling, so we will pause polling once user switches tabs. It is `false` by default, so we won't pause initial call by accident.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hoxyq/react/blob/af8beeebf63b5824497fcd0bb35b7c0ac8fe60a0/packages/react-devtools-shared/src/backendAPI.js#L96",

This is a mistake and we will warn.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is the optimistic update is inside an async action, but after an `await`. In this case, we can make it \"just work\" by associating the optimistic update with the pending async action.\r\n\r\nTechnically it's possible that the optimistic update is unrelated to the pending action, but we don't have a way of knowing this for sure because browsers currently do not provide a way to track async scope. (The AsyncContext proposal, if it lands, will solve this in the future.) However, this is no different than the problem of unrelated transitions being grouped together \u2014 it's not wrong per se, but it's not ideal.\r\n\r\nOnce AsyncContext starts landing in browsers, we will provide better warnings in development for these cases.",

We check for changes by comparing the new state to `hook.memoizedState`. However, when implementing optimistic state rebasing, I incorrectly reset `hook.memoizedState` to the incoming base state, even though I only needed to reset `hook.baseState`. This was just a mistake on my part.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't caught by the existing tests because usually when the optimistic state changes, there's also some other state that marks the component as dirty in the same render.\r\n\r\nI fixed the bug and added a regression test.",

The old organization has <em>many</em> approved owners and thus a new repository could (in theory) be created at the old URL, circumventing Github's automatic redirect that is in place now and serving malicious code. I (<a href=\"https://github.com/qix\"><code>@\u200bqix</code></a>-) also wouldn't have access to that repository, so while I don't think it would happen, it's still something to consider.</p>\n<p>Even in such a case, however, the officially released package on npm (<code>debug</code>) would <em>not</em> be affected. That package is still very much under control (even more than it used to be).</p>\n<h3>Q: What should I do if I encounter an issue related to the migration?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/debug-js/debug/issues?q=label%3Amigration+\">Search the issues first</a> to see if someone has already reported it, and <em>then</em> open a new issue if someone has not.</p>\n<h3>Q: Why was this done as a 'patch' release? Isn't this breaking?</h3>\n<p>No, it shouldn't be breaking. The package on npm shouldn't be affected (aside from this patch release) and any references to the old repository should automatically redirect.</p>\n<p>Thus, according to all of the &quot;APIs&quot; (loosely put) involved, nothing should have broken.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

        "body": "This lets a registered object or value be \"tainted\", which we block from crossing the serialization boundary. It's only allowed to stay in-memory.\r\n\r\nThis is an extra layer of protection against mistakes of transferring data from a data access layer to a client. It doesn't provide perfect protection, because it doesn't trace through derived values and substrings. So it shouldn't be used as the only security layer but more layers are better.\r\n\r\n`taintObjectReference` is for specific object instances, not any nested objects or values inside that object. It's useful to avoid specific objects from getting passed as is. It ensures that you don't accidentally leak values in a specific context. It can be for security reasons like tokens, privacy reasons like personal data or performance reasons like avoiding passing large objects over the wire.\r\n\r\nIt might be privacy violation to leak the age of a specific user, but the number itself isn't blocked in any other context. As soon as the value is extracted and passed specifically without the object, it can therefore leak.\r\n\r\n`taintUniqueValue` is useful for high entropy values such as hashes, tokens or crypto keys that are very unique values. In that case it can be useful to taint the actual primitive values themselves. These can be encoded as a string, bigint or typed array. We don't currently check for this value in a substring or inside other typed arrays.\r\n\r\nSince values can be created from different sources they don't just follow garbage collection. In this case an additional object must be provided that defines the life time of this value for how long it should be blocked. It can be `globalThis` for essentially forever, but that risks leaking memory for ever when you're dealing with dynamic values like reading a token from a database. So in that case the idea is that you pass the object that might end up in cache.\r\n\r\nA request is the only thing that is expected to do any work. The principle is that you can derive values from out of a tainted\r\nentry during a request. Including stashing it in a per request cache. What you can't do is store a derived value in a global module level cache. At least not without also tainting the object.",

So the fix is to also check for `PropertyDefinition` in the lint rule.\r\n\r\n**Open question:** Is this considered a breaking change? These violations would have been flagged with `@typescript-eslint/parser` v4 and older, but if a repo upgraded to >= v5, new violations could have been introduced, which would cause build breaks when the rule is updated.\r\n\r\nFixes #27431\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n- Updated the `rules-of-hooks` tests to run with more parsers (including typescript-eslint v4 and v5) and verified that they pass\r\n- Made the same change in the installed copy of `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` in another repo (wasn't sure how to build the plugin from my local react repo) and verified the error was flagged",

Often the better options are:\r\n\r\n- Read things off the url or global scope like params or cookies.\r\n- Use the module system for global dependency injection.\r\n- Use `React.cache()` to dedupe multiple things instead of computing once and passing down.\r\n\r\nThere are still legit use cases for Server Context but you have to be very careful not to pass any large data, so in generally we recommend against it anyway.\r\n\r\nYes, prop drilling is annoying but it's not impossible for the cases this is needed. I would personally always pick it over Server Context anyway.\r\n\r\nSemantically, Server Context also blocks object deduping due to how it plays out with Server Components that can't be deduped. This is much more important feature.\r\n\r\nSince it's already in canary along with the rest of RSC, we're adding a warning for a few versions before removing completely to help migration.",

        "body": "Today if you render a Suspense boundary outside `<body>` hydration doesn't really work correctly. This has to do with the nature of how we stream SSR content in from the server and parsing modes for browser HTML parsers.\r\n\r\nWhile the document tags (html, head, and body) need to be part of the shell it should be possible to support suspending outside of these tags when the fallback content and the primary content contain no inlined data. This is useful for rendering hoistable elements such as stylesheets and scripts which are flushed via different means than rendering in place. It could also be useful for side effects and other components that have no visual output.\r\n\r\nTechnically there streaming mechanics actually work for other kinds of content such as divs but React's warnings about tag nesting still apply. Any support for hydrating non-empty content inside this hoisted suspense boundaries is entirely coincidental and would warn in Dev regardless.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to get the suspense boundary markers to emit around the premable/postamble tags like `<html>` and `<body>` instead we treat the root and singletons as a sort of shared hydration space. We start hydrating in the head always and then when we enter the body we switch to body mode. Now when we enter the head or body via rendering that tag we don't always pick up the first child of that element but use the shared cursor for the root if it exists. This is in someways ananlagous to how an HTML parser works where it assumes a context and then transitions when certain conditions are met.\r\n\r\nIn the course of implementing this feature it became apparent that we were not handling frameset correctly in a singletons world. Prior to this hydration change this was masked because the current method happened to work still. However with this hydration change I also had to convert frameset into a body-like singleton. I could remove this to save code size but that will require removing some tests and I wanted to first see how big an impact adding this support is. long term frameset is not really compatible with modern React because it breaks our streaming approach. Any support we try to maintain woudl only be for client only applications and I am skeptical that this is used by a meaningful amount of React projects.\r\n\r\nOne area that is still not supported for suspense boundaries is in between `<head>` and `<body>`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>...</head>\r\n  <Suspense>...</Suspense>\r\n  <body>...</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe comments end up after the closing `</head>` tag and the placeholder template ends up inside the `<head>`. This doesn't seems particularly critical to support so I will leave it as an edge case for now (it already is an edge case) and figure out how to warn effectively for this",

I track the fallbacks in a separate replay node so that when we resume, we can replay the fallback itself and finish the fallback and then possibly later the content. By doing this we also ensure we don't complete the parent too early since now it has a render task on it.\r\n\r\nThere is one case that this surfaces that isn't limited to prerender/resume but also render/hydrateRoot. I left todos in the tests for this.\r\n\r\nIf you postpone in a fallback, and suspend in the content but eventually don't postpone in the content then we should be able to just skip postponing since the content rendered and we no longer need the fallback. This is a bit of a weird edge case though since fallbacks are supposed to be very minimal.\r\n\r\nThis happens because in both cases the fallback starts rendering early as soon as the content suspends. This also ensures that the parent doesn't complete early by increasing the blocking tasks. Unfortunately, the fallback will irreversibly postpone its parent boundary as soon as it hits a postpone.\r\n\r\nWhen you suspend, the same thing happens but we typically deal with this by doing a \"soft\" abort on the fallback since we don't need it anymore which unblocks the parent boundary. We can't do that with postpone right now though since it's considered a terminal state.\r\n\r\nI think I'll just leave this as is for now since it's an edge case but it's an annoying exception in the model.

This object stores the style rules to flush as part of style tags using precedence as well as all the stylesheets associated with the precedence.

Additionally stylesheets encode chunks lazily because we may never write them as html if they are discovered late.\r\n\r\nThe preload props transfer is now maximally compact (only stores the props we would ever actually adopt) and only stores props for stylesheets and scripts because other preloads have no resource counterpart to adopt props into. The ResumableState maps that track which keys have been observed are being overloaded. Previously if a key was found it meant that a resource already exists (either in this render or in a prior prerender). Now we discriminate between null and object values.

The error only affects any child that is not yet completed. Therefore the error kind of gets thrown at the resumable point.\r\n\r\nThe resumable point might be a hole in the replay path, in which case throwing there errors the parent boundary just the same as if the replay component errored. If the hole is inside a deeper Suspense boundary though, then it's that Suspense boundary that gets client rendered. I.e. the child boundary. We can still finish any siblings.\r\n\r\nIn the shell all resumable points are inside a boundary since we must have finished the shell.

Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9.

I figured it could be nice to reuse the value if there has been no change.\r\n\r\nOne possible concern is if the user is doing unholy things with the returned array, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction C() {\r\n  const stateResult = useState(0)\r\n  const [state, setState] = stateResult\r\n  const arrayMineNow = stateResult\r\n  arrayMineNow[0] = 42\r\n  arrayMineNow[1] = 42\r\n  return (<button onClick={() => setState(state + 1)}>{state}</button>)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut such abnormal usage could be caught by e.g. sealing the array in dev.\r\n\r\n### How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n`yarn test` and `yarn test --prod`",

For instance precedence can be null/undefined because we deafult it to 'default' however we don't cosnider this an option because it is not something we transparently apply as props to the underlying instance.\r\n* Fixes a problem with keying images in flight where srcset and sizes were not being taken into account.\r\n* Moves argument validation into the ReactDOMFloat file where it is shared with all runtimes that expose these methods\r\n* Fixes crossOrigin serialization to use empty string except when 'use-credentials'\r\n",

In Fiber, we don't deal with this because we just suspend the parent and replay it if lazy() or Usable are used in its child slots. In Fizz we try to optimize this a bit more and enable resuming inside the component.\r\n\r\nSemantically, it's different if you suspend/postpone before the first child array or inside that child array. Because when you resume the inner result might be another array and either that's part of the parent path or part of the inner slot.\r\n\r\nThere might be more clever way of structuring this but I just use -1 to indicate that we're not yet inside the array and is in the root child position. If that renders an element, then that's just the same as the 0 slot.\r\n\r\nWe need to also encode this in the resuming. I called that resuming the element or resuming the slot.",

This will probably not work well for Firefox, since we are still on manifest v2, I will try to fix this in the next few PRs.\r\n- Handling the case when devtools page port was reconnected and bridge is still present. This could happen if user switches the tab and Chrome decides to kill service worker, devtools page port gets disconnected, and then user returns back to the tab. When port is reconnected, we check if bridge message listener is present, connecting them if so.\r\n- Added simple debounce when evaluating if page has react application running. We start this check in `chrome.network.onNavigated` listener, which is asynchronous. Also, this check itself is asynchronous, so previously we could mount React DevTools multiple times if navigates multiple times while `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval` (which is also asynchronous) can be executed. https://github.com/hoxyq/react/blob/00b7c4331819289548b40714aea12335368e10f4/packages/react-devtools-extensions/src/main/index.js#L575-L583\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/28902667/9d519a77-145e-413c-b142-b5063223d073\r\n\r\n",

Previously this was of little consequence but with Float the Root mode started to be used for things like determining if we could flush hoistable elements yet. In issue #27177 we see that hoisted elements can appear before the <html> tag when using a legacy API `renderToString`.\r\n\r\nThis change exports a DOCTYPE from FizzConfigDOM and FizzConfigDOMLegacy respectively, using an empty chunk in the legacy case. The only runtime perf cost here is that for legacy APIs there is an extra empty chunk to write when rendering a top level <html> tag which is trivial enough\r\n\r\nFixes #27177 \r\n",

        "body": "This exposes a `resume()` API to go with the `prerender()` (only in experimental). It doesn't work yet since we don't yet emit the postponed state so not yet tested.\r\n\r\nThe main thing this does is rename ResponseState->RenderState and Resources->ResumableState. We separated out resources into a separate concept preemptively since it seemed like separate enough but probably doesn't warrant being a separate concept. The result is that we have a per RenderState in the Config which is really just temporary state and things that must be flushed completely in the prerender. Most things should be ResumableState.\r\n\r\nMost options are specified in the `prerender()` and transferred into the `resume()` but certain options that are unique per request can't be. Notably `nonce` is special. This means that bootstrap scripts and external runtime can't use `nonce` in this mode. They need to have a CSP configured to deal with external scripts, but not inline.\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to restore state of things that we've already emitted in the prerender. We could have separate snapshot/restore methods that does this work when it happens but that means we have to explicitly do that work. This design is trying to keep to the principle that we just work with resumable data structures instead so that we're designing for it with every feature. It also makes restoring faster since it's just straight into the data structure.\r\n\r\nThis is not yet a serializable format. That can be done in a follow up.\r\n\r\nWe also need to vet that each step makes sense. Notably stylesToHoist is a bit unclear how it'll work.",

The \"Suspensey commit\" implementation relies on the `shouldRemainOnPreviousScreen` function to determine whether to 1) suspend the commit 2) activate a parent fallback and schedule a retry. The issue was that we were sometimes attempting option 2 even when there was no parent fallback.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason this bug landed is due to how `throwException` is structured. In the case of Suspensey commits, we pass a special \"noop\" thenable to `throwException` as a way to trigger the Suspense path. This special thenable must never have a listener attached to it. This is not a great way to structure the logic, it's just a consequence of how the code evolved over time. We should refactor it into multiple functions so we can trigger a fallback directly without having to check the type. In the meantime, I added an internal warning to help detect similar mistakes in the future.",

        "body": "This adds an experimental `unstable_postpone(reason)` API.\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't have a way to model effectively an Infinite Promise. I.e. something that suspends but never resolves. The reason this is useful is because you might have something else that unblocks it later. E.g. by updating in place later, or by client rendering.\r\n\r\nOn the client this works to model as an Infinite Promise (in fact, that's what this implementation does). However, in Fizz and Flight that doesn't work because the stream needs to end at some point. We don't have any way of knowing that we're suspended on infinite promises. It's not enough to tag the promises because you could await those and thus creating new promises. The only way we really have to signal this through a series of indirections like async functions, is by throwing. It's not 100% safe because these values can be caught but it's the best we can do.\r\n\r\nEffectively `postpone(reason)` behaves like a built-in [Catch Boundary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26854). It's like `raise(Postpone, reason)` except it's built-in so it needs to be able to be encoded and caught by Suspense boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn Flight and Fizz these behave pretty much the same as errors. Flight just forwards it to retrigger on the client. In Fizz they just trigger client rendering which itself might just postpone again or fill in the value. The difference is how they get logged.\r\n\r\nIn Flight and Fizz they log to `onPostpone(reason)` instead of `onError(error)`. This log is meant to help find deopts on the server like finding places where you fall back to client rendering. The reason that you pass in is for that purpose to help the reason for any deopts.\r\n\r\nI do track the stack trace in DEV but I don't currently expose it to `onPostpone`. This seems like a limitation. It might be better to expose the Postpone object which is an Error object but that's more of an implementation detail. I could also pass it as a second argument.\r\n\r\nOn the client after hydration they don't get passed to `onRecoverableError`. There's no global `onPostpone` API to capture postponed things on the client just like there's no `onError`. At that point it's just assumed to be intentional. It doesn't have any `digest` or reason passed to the client since it's not logged.\r\n\r\nThere are some hacky solutions that currently just tries to reuse as much of the existing code as possible but should be more properly implemented.\r\n- Fiber is currently just converting it to a fake Promise object so that it behaves like an infinite Promise.\r\n- Fizz is encoding the magic digest string `\"POSTPONE\"` in the HTML so we know to ignore it but it should probably just be something neater that doesn't share namespace with digests.\r\n\r\nNext I plan on using this in the `/static` entry points for additional features.\r\n\r\nWhy \"postpone\"? It's basically a synonym to \"defer\" but we plan on using \"defer\" for other purposes and it's overloaded anyway.",

        "body": "Stacked on #27224 \r\n\r\n### Implements `ReactDOM.preloadModule()`\r\n`preloadModule` is a function to preload modules of various types. Similar to `preload` this is useful when you expect to use a Resource soon but can't render that resource directly. At the moment the only sensible module to preload is script modules along with some other `as` variants such as `as=\"serviceworker\"`. In the future when there is some notion of how to preload style module script or json module scripts this API will be extended to support those as well.\r\n\r\n##### Arguments\r\n1. `href: string` -> the href or src value you want to preload.\r\n2. `options?: {...}` -> \r\n2.1. `options.as: string` -> the `as` property the modulepreload link should render with. If not provided it will be omitted which will cause the modulepreload to be treated like a script module\r\n2.2. `options.crossOrigin?: string` -> modules always load with CORS but you can provide `use-credentials` if you want to change the default behavior\r\n2.3. `options.integrity?: string` -> an integrity hash for subresource integrity APIs\r\n  \r\n##### Rendering\r\neach preloaded module will emit a `<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"...\" />`\r\nif `as` is specified and is something other than `\"script\"` the as attribute will also be included\r\nif crossOrigin or integrity as specified their attributes will also be included\r\n\r\nDuring SSR these script tags will be emitted before content. If we have not yet flushed the document head they will be emitted there after things that block paint such as font preloads, img preloads, and stylesheets.\r\n\r\nOn the client these link tags will be appended to the document.head.\r\n  \r\n### Implements `ReactDOM.preinitModule()`\r\n`preinitModule` is a function to loading module scripts before they are required. It has the same use cases as `preinit`. \r\n\r\nDuring SSR you would use this to tell the browsers to start fetching code that will be used without having to wait for bootstrapping to initiate module fetches.\r\n\r\nON the client you would use this to start fetching a module script early for an anticipated navigation or other event that is likely to depend on this module script.\r\n\r\nthe `as` property for Float methods drew inspiration from the `as` attribute of the `<link rel=\"preload\" ... >` tag but it is used as a sort of tag for the kind of thing being targetted by Float methods. For `preinitModule` we currently only support `as: \"script\"` and this is also the assumed default type so you current never need to specify this `as` value. In the future `preinitModule` will support additional module script types such as `style` or `json`. The support of these types will correspond to [Module Import Attributes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes).\r\n\r\n##### Arguments\r\n1. `href: string` -> the href or src value you want to preinitialize\r\n2. `options?: {...}` ->\r\n2.1 `options.as?: string` -> only supports `script` and this is the default behavior. Until we support import attributes such as `json` and `style` there will not be much reason to provide an `as` option.\r\n2.2. `options.crossOrigin?: string`: modules always load with CORS but you can provide `use-credentials` if you want to change the default behavior\r\n2.3 `options.integrity?: string` -> an integrity hash for subresource integrity APIs\r\n\r\n##### Rendering\r\neach preinitialized `script` module will emit a `<script type=\"module\" async=\"\" src\"...\">` During SSR these will appear behind display blocking resources such as font preloads, img preloads, and stylesheets. In the browser these will be appende to the head.\r\n\r\nNote that for other `as` types the rendered output will be slightly different. `<script type=\"module\">import \"...\" with {type: \"json\" }</script>`. Since this tag is an inline script variants of React that do not use inline scripts will simply omit these preinitialization tags from the SSR output. This is not implemented in this PR but will appear in a future update.\r\n\r\nEdit @eps1lon: Made `PreloadModuleOptions['as']` required to match Flow types and runtime warnings.",

As a step in that direction this change prioritizes these images for preloading to ensure the highest chance that they are loaded before boundaries reveal (or initial paint). every img rendered that is non lazy loading will emit a preload just behind fonts.\r\n\r\nThis change implements a new resource queue for high priority image preloads\r\n\r\nThere are a number of scenarios where we end up putting a preload in this queue\r\n\r\n1. If you render a non-lazy image and there are fewer than 10 high priority image preloads\r\n2. if you render a non-lazy image with fetchPriority \"high\"\r\n3. if you preload as \"image\" with fetchPriority \"high\"\r\n\r\nThis means that by default we won't overrsaturate this queue with every img rendered on the page but the earlier encountered ones will go first. Essentially this is React's own implementation of fetchPriority=\"auto\".\r\n\r\nIf however you specify that the fetchPriority is higher then in theory an unlimited number of images can preload in this queue. This gives users some control over queuing while still providing a good default that does not require any opting into\r\n\r\nAdditionally we use fetchPriority \"low\" as a signal that an image does not require preloading. This may end up being pointless if not using lazy (which also opts out of preloading) because it might delay initial paint but we'll start with this hueristic and consider changes in the future when we have more information",

This should make the preload operate similar to async script fetch priority which is low by default according to https://web.dev/fetch-priority/\r\n\r\nAdditionally the bootstrap script preloads will emit before preinitialized scripts do.

        "body": "This change does not alter any program semantics but reorganizes the codebase to better support multiple bundler builds for the same project. We will still (for now) publish under bundler specific packges like react-server-dom-webpack but more of the implementation will be shared and renderer configs can be kept simpler while still supporting a variety of packaging options\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the concept of a bundler config similar to how the renderer config works. It essentially opens up a second degree of freedom for forking  projects that is independent of the renderer so we can target multiple bundlers for a single renderer.\r\n\r\nadding bundler support to a host config requires adding a bundlers array to the inlinedHostConfig entry. The first bundler listed is the default bundler and won't be required to be specified when running yarn so\r\n```\r\nyarn flow dom-node\r\n```\r\nWill check the project in webpack mode\r\n\r\nThe yarn commands are slightly different now. you can provide an optional second arg specifying the bundler\r\n```\r\nyarn flow dom-node esm\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are currently 3 bundler targets\r\n* esm -> builds targeting ESM module loading (no true bundling)\r\n* webpack -> builds targeting webpack module loading\r\n* webpack-node -> builds targeting webpack but with node loading on the server\r\n\r\nWe expect there to be many more as additional variants of Flight binding projects get added such as for Vite and Turbopack\r\n\r\nWhile we don't get a lot of benefit from this reorganization immediately there are planned upcomging features that would have otherwise required the creation of additional renderers to properly arrange the right configuration values. For instance when we start to preinitialize module loading scripts in Flight the browser build for esm needs different configs than the node build but we couldn't move that into `dom-browser` because that is configured for webpack. We could of course just have added `dom-browser-esm` but that entails making a full set of fork files across all projects not just for Flight. Using bundler configs we can keep forks based on bundler limited to the renderers that actually support that bundler avoiding some unnecessary growth in fork files\r\n\r\nOne note on naming, while the concept of this second axis being a bundler config makes sense for Flight this may be useful in a more general sense for supporting things like a web streams build of for node which requires slightly different stream configs. I considered renaming this to `packaging config` or something else slightly more general. We can pursue that another time if we decide to move forward with this approach\r\n\r\nIf you consider the builds below you'll notice some of the client browser builds are slightly smaller. This is because they were previously packaged with the `dom-node-esm` config which is turned on for SSR and includes some extra server actions code. I've moved this entrypoint to `dom-browser esm` which does not have SSR active and this code is able to be removed at build time.",

These values are typically not necessary to be included in the dependency array of React hooks. Rules that forces including these stable values may result in unnecessary eslint warnings.\r\n\r\nThe rule name comes from the `isStableKnownHookValue()` within the exsisting eslint rule.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nSet `useTranslation()`(by react-i18next) to as stable hook.\r\n![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/63982863/dcea86e3-b2bb-45b0-88ad-6ffd0814528c)\r\n\r\n`value` depends on `str` and `t`, but since return value of `useTranslation()` is set as stable, eslint reports that only `str` is missing dependencies.\r\n![image](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/63982863/33ed2dde-ded6-4932-a83b-939f0a1fb344)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid.

        "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThere's a bug with the existing stack comparison algorithm in `describeNativeComponentFrame` \u2014 specifically how it attempts to find a common root frame between the control and sample stacks. This PR attempts to fix that bug by injecting a frame that can have a guaranteed string in it for us to search for in both stacks to find a common root.\r\n\r\n## Brief Background/How it works now\r\n\r\nRight now `describeNativeComponentFrame` does the following to leverage native browser/VM stack frames to get details (e.g. script path, row and col #s) for a single component:\r\n1. Throwing and catching a control error in the function\r\n2. Calling the component which should eventually throw an error (most of the time), that we'll catch as our sample error.\r\n3. Diffing the stacks in the control and sample errors to find the line which should represent our component call.\r\n\r\n## What's broken\r\n\r\nTo account for potential stack trace truncation, the stack diffing algorithm first attempts to find a common \"root\" frame by inspecting the earliest frame of the sample stack and searching for an identical frame in the control stack starting from the bottom. However, there are a couple of scenarios which I've hit that cause the above approach to not work correctly.\r\n\r\nFirst, it's possible that for render passes of extremely large component trees to have a lot of repeating internal react function calls, which can result in an incorrect common or \"root\" frame found. Here's a small example from a stack trace using React Fizz for SSR.\r\nOur control frame can look like this:\r\n```\r\nError:\r\n    at Fake (...)\r\n    at construct (native)\r\n    at describeNativeComponentFrame (...)\r\n    at describeClassComponentFrame (...)\r\n    at getStackByComponentStackNode (...)\r\n    at getCurrentStackInDEV (...)\r\n    at renderNodeDestructive (...)\r\n    at renderElement (...)\r\n    at renderNodeDestructiveImpl (...) // <-- Actual common root frame with the sample stack\r\n    at renderNodeDestructive (...)\r\n    at renderElement (...)\r\n    at renderNodeDestructiveImpl (...) // <-- Incorrectly chosen common root frame\r\n    at renderNodeDestructive (...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd our sample stack can look like this:\r\n```\r\nError:\r\n    at set (...)\r\n    at PureComponent (...)\r\n    at call (native)\r\n    at apply (native)\r\n    at ErrorBoundary (...)\r\n    at construct (native)\r\n    at describeNativeComponentFrame (...)\r\n    at describeClassComponentFrame (...)\r\n    at getStackByComponentStackNode (...)\r\n    at getCurrentStackInDEV (...)\r\n    at renderNodeDestructive (...)\r\n    at renderElement (...)\r\n    at renderNodeDestructiveImpl (...) // <-- Root frame that's common in the control stack\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere you can see that the earliest trace in the sample stack, the `renderNodeDestructiveImpl` call, can exactly match with multiple `renderNodeDestructiveImpl` calls in the control stack (including file path and line + col #s). Currently the algorithm will chose the earliest/last frame with the `renderNodeDestructiveImpl` call (which is the second last frame in our control stack), which is incorrect. The actual matching frame in the control stack is the latest or first frame (when traversing from the top) with the `renderNodeDestructiveImpl` call. This leads to the rest of the stack diffing associating an incorrect frame (`at getStackByComponentStackNode (...)`) for the component.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with this approach is that it assumes all VMs will truncate stack traces at the *bottom*, [which isn't the case for the Hermes VM](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/blob/df07cf713a84a4434c83c08cede38ba438dc6aca/lib/VM/JSError.cpp#L688-L699) which **truncates stack traces in the middle**, placing a\r\n\r\n```\r\n    at renderNodeDestructiveImpl (...)\r\n    ... skipping {n} frames\r\n    at renderNodeDestructive (...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nline in the middle of the stack trace for all stacks that contain more than 100 traces. This causes stack traces for React Native apps using the Hermes VM to potentially break for large component trees. Although for this specific case with Hermes, it's possible to account for this by either manually grepping and removing the `... skipping` line and everything below it (see draft PR: #26999), or by implementing the non-standard `prepareStackTrace` API which Hermes also supports to manually generate a stack trace that truncates from the bottom ([example implementation](https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/main...KarimP:react:component-stack-hermes-fix)).\r\n\r\n## The Fix\r\n\r\nI found different ways to go about fixing this. The first was to search for a common stack frame starting from the top/latest frame. It's a relatively small change ([see implementation](https://github.com/facebook/react/compare/main...KarimP:react:component-stack-fix-2)), although it is less performant by being n^2 (albeit with `n` realistically being <= 5 here). It's also a bit more buggy for class components given that different VMs insert a different amount of additional lines for new/construct calls...\r\n\r\nAnother fix would be to actually implement a [longest common substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring) algorithm, which can also be roughly n^2 time (assuming the longest common substring between control and sample will be most of the sample frame).\r\n\r\nThe fix I ended up going with was have the lines that throw the control error and the lines that call/instantiate the component be inside a distinct method under an object property (`\"DescribeNativeComponentFrameRoot\"`). All major VMs (Safari's JavaScriptCore, Firefox's SpiderMonkey, V8, Hermes, and Bun) should display the object property name their stack trace. I've also set the `name` and `displayName` properties for method as well to account for minification, any advanced optimizations (e.g. key crushing), and VM inconsistencies (both Bun and Safari seem to exclusively use the value under `displayName` and not `name` in traces for methods defined under an object's own property...).\r\n\r\nWe can then find this \"common\" frame by simply finding the line that has our special method name (`\"DescribeNativeComponentFrameRoot\"`), and the rest of the code to determine the actual component line works as expected. If by any chance we don't find a frame with our special method name in either control or sample stack traces, we then revert back to the existing approach mentioned above by searching for the last line of the sample frame in the control frame.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n1. There are bunch of existing tests that ensure a properly formatted component trace is logged for certain scenarios, so I ensured the existing full test suite passed\r\n2. I threw an error in a component that's deep in the component hierarchy of a large React app (facebook) to ensure there's stack trace truncation, and ensured the correct component stack trace was logged for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and with and without minification.\r\n3. Ran a large React app (facebook) on the Hermes VM, threw an error in a component that's deep in the component hierarchy, and ensured that component frames are generated despite stack traces being truncated in the middle.\r\n",

By following the instructions at [https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html) I was able to link react and react-dom packages to the repository which has the error reproducible: [https://github.com/SF97/react-input-element-bug](https://github.com/SF97/react-input-element-bug) \r\n2. I tried to reproduce the bug with the changes, and I was not able to do it\r\n\r\n## Important decision\r\n\r\nI've added a fallback to the current implementation when the descriptor has been deleted during the web page execution. This was mainly to fall back to the old implementation in the case there are any caveats I've missed, but I'm not opposed to removing it if necessary\r\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix #26876, which is caused by not updating tracked values. Please see [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/26876#issuecomment-1611037027) for the investigation details. \r\n\r\nThe root is, when one radio is changed to be checked (by updating the `checked` prop), the previously checked one won't update its tracked value (will be still  `'true'`) if it's one of the previous siblings. \r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTesting Steps (refer to but not exactly follow the steps of reproduction):\r\n- Two radios with the same name, initially, radio1 is checked, and radio2 is unchecked. (radio1 is the previous sibling of radio2)\r\n- Update the `checked` props to make radio1 unchecked, and radio2 checked.\r\n- Then update the `checked` props to make radio1 checked, and radio2 unchecked.\r\n- Click radio2, the `onChange` handler should be called after fixing the issue.\r\n\r\nAny feedback and suggestions will be appreciated. cc @eps1lon @sebmarkbage @acdlite ",

        "body": "Suspending with an uncached promise is not yet supported. We only support suspending on promises that are cached between render attempts. (We do plan to partially support this in the future, at least in certain constrained cases, like during a route transition.)\r\n\r\nThis includes the case where a component returns an uncached promise, which is effectively what happens if a Client Component is authored using async/await syntax.\r\n\r\nThis is an easy mistake to make in a Server Components app, because async/await _is_ available in Server Components.\r\n\r\nIn the current behavior, this can sometimes cause the app to crash with an infinite loop, because React will repeatedly keep trying to render the component, which will result in a fresh promise, which will result in a new render attempt, and so on. We have some strategies we can use to prevent this \u2014 during a concurrent render, we can suspend the work loop until the promise resolves. If it's not a concurrent render, we can show a Suspense fallback and try again at concurrent priority.\r\n\r\nThere's one case where neither of these strategies work, though: during a sync render when there's no parent Suspense boundary. (We refer to this as the \"shell\" of the app because it exists outside of any loading UI.)\r\n\r\nSince we don't have any great options for this scenario, we should at least error gracefully instead of crashing the app.\r\n\r\nSo this commit adds a detection mechanism for render loops caused by async client components. The way it works is, if an app suspends repeatedly in the shell during a synchronous render, without committing anything in between, we will count the number of attempts and eventually trigger an error once the count exceeds a threshold.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we will consider ways to make this case a warning instead of a hard error.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/26801 for more details.",

        "body": "Been weeks, i Discovered a strange activity of React while we try to render a input type of `checkbox`, when i have both an `onClick` handler and as well as an `onChange` handler, if i have added a `preventDefault` function, that should behave as it should not allow the onChange event to kick in! strangely it is not the behaviour it is producing, to confirm the same, i tried to reproduce the same Behaviour with Vanilla JavaScript and it did not behaved the same as of React. \r\n\r\n**Behaviour with Current React version**\r\non the Initial render, the OnChange event function gets called up , which should not be the case \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/7e6a3627-6f29-461a-bc74-fb68f6a5ca28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Codesandboxlink below for the error reproduction**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/bitter-forest-gytgph?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n\r\n**Behaviour with Vanilla JavaScript**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/13d6ba5d-796b-4986-8d3e-8f9d77911690\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that i came to after seeing this, React is sort of trying to retrieve the checked value of the Node, even before our `preventDefault` function, is called.\r\n\r\nIn my mental model,  Initially the value of the `node.checked` seems to be true, As soon as we hit the first click this seem to generate something like:-\r\n\r\n```\r\nprevValue = false,\r\nnextValue = true,\r\n```\r\nand on next subsequent clicks on the checkbox, our `change` event does not get fired since the value looks like\r\n```\r\nprevValue = true,\r\nnextValue = true,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution seems to be pretty straight forward i went on to just add a condition to check for such when the prevent is there to just ignore the `onChange` event, I have tested the behaviour across chrome, safari and firefox and it seemed to work consistently across all! the test according to me is also passing as you can see below from the test snapshot\r\n<img width=\"1435\" alt=\"webstorm test pass image\" src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/84c0a3fe-fceb-4c68-8ef1-2b40e5d82e52\">\r\n\r\nWorking preview of the same across different Browsers\r\n\r\n**Chrome**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/eb24b801-6ad5-4497-ab6a-c4b5d8ba9909\r\n\r\n**Firefox**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/e9c0a512-ab52-4e7e-94ff-4327feaaa5ea\r\n\r\n**Safari**\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/bca07e0b-e1f1-4f61-9696-d86e40649fb4\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This PR fixes that by first parsing out and removing the `\"   ... skipping\"` line, and everything below it. This mimics the behaviour of the stack traces being truncated at the bottom, which the method correctly accounts for.\r\n\r\nTo test this out better, I extracted the code that diffs the control and sample stacks to determine the component line into another function that gets called by `describeNativeComponentFrame`.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nCreated a new jest test to confirm both the existing and new behaviour:\r\n```\r\nyarn test determineComponentFrameFromStack-test\r\n```\r\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Motivation:\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed in this pull request are designed to address upcoming changes in the Chrome browser. Starting with Chrome 101, the use of navigator.userAgent, navigator.appVersion, and navigator.platform are being discouraged and are subject to future deprecation. These properties are currently used in our codebase to determine the user's browser type and theme.\r\n\r\nThe pull request aims to modernize the codebase and keep it up-to-date with recent browser practices, ensuring its compatibility with newer versions of Chrome while maintaining its functionality in other major browsers.\r\n\r\n#### Problem solved:\r\n\r\nThe pull request solves the problem of potential incompatibility and reduced functionality in future Chrome versions due to the aforementioned deprecation. If we continued using these properties, from Chrome 101 onward, our code could fail to accurately detect the user's browser type and theme.\r\n\r\nThis code checks the user agent string of the user's browser to determine whether they're using Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. It uses navigator.userAgent and searches for the presence of 'Edge', 'Firefox', 'Chrome'.\r\n\r\nThe getBrowserName function returns the browser name based on the checks made earlier, and getBrowserTheme returns whether the user has chosen a dark or light theme in their browser dev tools.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Testing Steps:\r\n\r\n#### Automated Unit Testing: \r\nAutomated tests were added to verify the function getBrowserName returns the correct browser name for different user agent data. Mocking was used to simulate different browsers' user agent data. This way, we can automatically and repeatedly test our code against many different scenarios.\r\n\r\n#### Manual Testing:\r\n The application was manually tested on different browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. This manual testing is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in real-world scenarios. I verified that the function correctly identified the browser name and theme in each case.\r\n\r\n#### Browser Version Testing: \r\nTesting was conducted on different versions of Chrome, specifically versions below 101 and versions 101 and above. For Chrome versions 101 and above, navigator.userAgentData was available and was used correctly to identify the browser type. For versions below 101, I ensured the application behaves as expected and doesn't throw any errors related to navigator.userAgentData not being available.\r\n\r\n#### Testing Theme Detection: \r\n For each browser, both the 'light' and 'dark' themes were tested to ensure the function getBrowserTheme returned the correct theme.\r\n\r\n#### Verifying the solution:\r\n\r\nThe output from the getBrowserName and getBrowserTheme functions was compared against the expected values for each scenario. This allowed us to verify that the PR solves the issue it set out to address, i.e., correctly identifying the browser type and theme in light of the upcoming deprecation in Chrome 101.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-06-20 at 21 47 59](https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/62898968/adbbd934-791b-4a05-952c-338c49b90db9)\r\n",

We reuse updateHostComponent for HostSingleton and HostHoistables since it has a somewhat complex path but that means you have to remember when editing updateHostComponent that it's not just used for that tag.

        "body": "This uses the same mechanism as [large strings](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26932) to encode chunks of length based binary data in the RSC payload behind a flag.\r\n\r\nI introduce a new BinaryChunk type that's specific to each stream and ways to convert into it. That's because we sometimes need all chunks to be Uint8Array for the output, even if the source is another array buffer view, and sometimes we need to clone it before transferring.\r\n\r\nEach type of typed array is its own row tag. This lets us ensure that the instance is directly in the right format in the cached entry instead of creating a wrapper at each reference. Ideally this is also how Map/Set should work but those are lazy which complicates that approach a bit.\r\n\r\nWe assume both server and client use little-endian for now. If we want to support other modes, we'd convert it to/from little-endian so that the transfer protocol is always little-endian. That way the common clients can be the fastest possible.\r\n\r\nSo far this only implements Server to Client. Still need to implement Client to Server for parity.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is the first time we make RSC effectively a binary format. This is not compatible with existing SSR techniques which serialize the stream as unicode in the HTML. To be compatible, those implementations would have to use base64 or something like that. Which is what we'll do when we move this technique to be built-in to Fizz.",

However when preloading responsive images it is possible that you may need more than one preload for differing imagesizes attributes. When using imagesrcset for preloads the href attribute acts more like a fallback href. For keying purposes the imagesrcset becomes the primary key conceptually.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the keying logic for `ReactDOM.preload()` when you pass `{as: \"image\"}`\r\n\r\n1. If `options.imageSrcSet` is a non-emtpy string the key is defined as `options.imageSrcSet + options.imageSizes`. The `href` argument is still required but does not participate in keying.\r\n2. If `options.imageSrcSet` is empty, missing, or an invalid format the key is defined as the `href`. Changing the `options.imageSizes` does not affect the key as this option is inert when not using `options.imageSrcSet`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, currently there is a bug in webkit (Safari) that causes preload links to fail to use imageSrcSet and fallback to href even when the browser will correctly resolve srcset on an `<img>` tag. Because the drawbacks of preloading the wrong image (href over imagesrcset) in a modern browser outweight the drawbacks of not preloading anything for responsive images in browsers that do not support srcset at all we will omit the `href` attribute whenever `options.imageSrcSet` is provided. We still require you provide an href since we want to be able to revert this behavior once all major browsers support it\r\n\r\nbug link: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231150",

The difference is that now there's a separate reference to it.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit awkward because for multiple reference to the same value, it'd be a new Map/Set instance for each reference. So to encode sharing, it needs one level of indirection with its own ID. That's not really a big deal for other types since they're inline anyway - but since this needs to be outlined it creates possibly two ids where there only needs to be one or zero.\r\n\r\nOne variant would be to encode this in the row type. Another variant would be something like what we do for React Elements where they're arrays but tagged with a symbol. For simplicity I stick with the simple outlining for now.",

We can't do that if we pass arbitrary unicode without escaping it. Instead, we pass the byte length (in hexadecimal) in the leading header for this row tag followed by a comma.\r\n\r\nWe could be clever and use fixed or variable-length binary integers for the row id and length but it's not worth the more difficult debuggability so we keep these human readable in text.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, we used to decode the binary stream into UTF-8 strings before parsing them. This is inefficient because sometimes the slices end up having to be copied so it's better to decode it directly into the format. The follow up to this is also to add support for binary data and then we can't assume the entire payload is UTF-8 anyway. So this refactors the parser to parse the rows in binary and then decode the result into UTF-8. It does add some overhead to decoding on a per row basis though.\r\n\r\nSince we do this, we need to encode the byte length that we want decode - not the string length. Therefore, this requires clients to receive binary data and why I had to delete the string option.\r\n\r\nIt also means that I had to add a way to get the byteLength from a chunk since they're not always binary. For Web streams it's easy since they're always typed arrays. For Node streams it's trickier so we use the byteLength helper which may not be very efficient. Might be worth eagerly encoding them to UTF8 - perhaps only for this case.",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nVite is one of the most popular bundlers used to build React apps. This PR is adding a vite integration for React server components. It would be shame if the usage of React server components is restricted to webpack or Next.js's bundler. \r\n\r\nThe current experiments that use vite with React server components, all hack into the `react-server-dom-webpack` package and shim the environment that webpack expects, specifically `__webpack_chunk_load__` and `__webpack_require__`. \r\n\r\nWhile it is okay as a starting point, it would be good to get a deeper integration with vite that recognizes vite's lazy by default approach to doing work, and its ESM first nature. One big issue with the webpack integration is HMR. Right now because it caches the modules it loads with no way to invalidate that cache, performing HMR in vite's style requires some stupid hacks. Ideally this should be handled properly by exposing a way to invalidate the module cache. We do this by exposing `__vite_module_cache__`. We also expose a `__vite_require__` function for the integration, (similar to `__webpack_require__`). This allows the user to specify how the module loading should behave between dev and prod.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n* SSR Server (`global`): Uses vite to serve client assets and transformed ESM modules to the browser. Also uses vite to load client components for SSR. We setup the environment with `__vite_require__` and `__vite_module_cache__` which uses vite during development and the built manifests during production.\r\n\r\n* React Server (`region`): Uses vite to load the app entry `src/App.jsx` with the appropriate resolve conditions (\"react-server\"). It also uses vite to load the server action module when called by the client. We setup the environment with `__vite_require__` and `__vite_module_cache__` which uses vite during development and the built manifests during production.\r\n\r\nA few aspects left to clean up:\r\n1. Reference IDs, how to represent: I have seen them being represented as `module/path#export`. I tried saving them as `[\"module/path\",\"export\"]`. But it looks like with form actions it treats the string as the ID and so it doesn't work well with the array representation. So might have to change it all to just use the old `module/path#export` format.\r\n2. CSS asset handling for vite. By default it loads the CSS using JS in the browser. But this causes FOUC which is undesirable. We need to go through the module tree and track which CSS files are being imported in that tree and add `link` tags for those. Should be able to be handled at a meta-framework level.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a fixture `flight-vite` that's modelled after the `flight-esm` and `flight-webpack` fixtures. During development, the `global` and `region` servers use vite to parse, load and transform the modules for SSR and creating an ESM dev server for the browser. A build script is added to use vite to build the react server, SSR server and the client bundles. In production, using `yarn start`, the `global` and `region` servers use the manifests produced by vite to know where to load the bundled modules from for the react-server, SSR and browser.",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\nWe are upgrading React 17 codebase to React18, and `StrictMode` has been great for surfacing potential production bugs on React18 for class components. There are non-trivial number of test failures caused by double `useEffect` in StrictMode. To prioritize surfacing and fixing issues that will break in production now, we need a flag to turn off double `useEffect` for now in StrictMode temporarily.  This is a Meta-only hack for rolling out `createRoot` and we will fast follow to remove it and use full strict mode.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid.

Such case occurs when RN's application being debugged via React DevTools.\r\n\r\nReact DevTools sends instance to RN, which then gets all auxiliary data to highlight some elements. Having `getInspectorDataForInstance` method exposed makes it possible to easily get current props from fiber, which then can be used to display some margins & paddings for hovered element (via props.style).\r\n\r\nI see that `getInspectorDataForInstance` is being exported at the top level of the renderer, but feels like this should also be inside DevTools global hook, the same way we use it for [`getInspectorDataForViewAtPoint`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/e7d3662904e0e35e43380ee6d54859388713a592/packages/react-native/Libraries/Inspector/getInspectorDataForViewAtPoint.js).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
