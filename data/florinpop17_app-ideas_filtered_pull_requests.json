The idea seems simple on the surface, but as we dig deeper into how the system works and what features a robust bug tracker should contain, more complex concepts emerge.\r\n\r\nBecause of the variable levels of complexity that a bug tracker project can have depending on how far down the rabbit hole we go, I always like to recommend this as a good first or second project at the \"advanced\" level. For one, it ties together multiple programming concepts like UI design/development, back-end data modeling, potential database usage, state management, and more. Also, bug tracker projects have lots of good \"stopping points\" where code can be pushed and used while starting to do research for the next feature, which may itself be on a different complexity level.\r\n\r\n### PR Details\r\n\r\nI think the Markdown file that I've put together is a great guide to building a basic bug tracker application and I think that it also leaves enough room for a high level of individualization from project to project. \r\n\r\nI'd love any suggestions or additions if we think there is anything that should be added for a basic bug tracker application. There's certainly room for more advanced features and functionality here, but I'm uncertain whether we should list out more possibilities under the \"Bonus Features\" section or leave them up to the imagination of the folks building the application.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
