Hopefully, this will give us better error messages or cause the app to crash and end the test early (rather than timeout after 30 minutes).\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement].\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt].\r\n- [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the #hackers-new channel on [Discord].\r\n\r\n<!-- Links -->\r\n[Contributor Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#overview\r\n[Tree Hygiene]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene\r\n[test-exempt]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#tests\r\n[Flutter Style Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo\r\n[Features we expect every widget to implement]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#features-we-expect-every-widget-to-implement\r\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com/\r\n[flutter/tests]: https://github.com/flutter/tests\r\n[breaking change policy]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#handling-breaking-changes\r\n[Discord]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat\r\n\n",

In these cases, we lack a way of expressing that the builder callback is not needed -- and we end up doing superfluous work.\r\n\r\nThis PR gives subclasses the ability to know exactly when the callback needs to be called and when it can be skipped.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement].\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt].\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n",

If you are running an analysis on Windows and using Python 3.12 or later, the CodeQL Action will switch to running Python 3.11. In this case, if Python 3.11 is not found, then the workflow will fail. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1928\">#1928</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.0 - 06 Oct 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action now requires CodeQL version 2.10.5 or later.

Currently file coverage information for each of these pairs of languages is grouped together. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1903\">#1903</a></li>\n<li>Add a warning to help customers avoid inadvertently analyzing the same CodeQL language in multiple matrix jobs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1901\">#1901</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.8 - 19 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.10.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 12 September 2023 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6, and will be unsupported by the next minor release of the CodeQL Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1884\">#1884</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.10.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.9.5 and 2.10.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.21.7</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Enable the following language aliases when using CodeQL 2.14.4 and later: <code>c-cpp</code> for C/C++ analysis, <code>java-kotlin</code> for Java/Kotlin analysis, and <code>javascript-typescript</code> for JavaScript/TypeScript analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1883\">#1883</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.7 - 14 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1882\">#1882</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.6 - 13 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Better error message when there is a failure to determine the merge base of the code to analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1860\">#1860</a></li>\n<li>Improve the calculation of default amount of RAM used for query execution on GitHub Enterprise Server. This now reduces in proportion to the runner's total memory to better account for system memory usage, helping to avoid out-of-memory failures on larger runners.

        "body": "Some of our tests in CI are triggering the `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` dialog when they're not supposed to (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/129836) since it's disabled via flags (`--no-publish-port` for flutter/flutter and `--disable-vm-service-publication` for flutter/engine).\r\n\r\nNormally, we inject `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` (and other bonjour settings) to the Info.plist during the project build for debug and profile mode since by default they will publish the VM Service port over mDNS.\r\n\r\nTo help diagnose the issue, though, this PR changes it so that we don't inject `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` (and other bonjour settings) when port publication is disabled since it shouldn't be needed. Hopefully, this will give us better error messages or cause the app to crash and end the test early (rather than timeout after 30 minutes).\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement].\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt].\r\n- [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the #hackers-new channel on [Discord].\r\n\r\n<!-- Links -->\r\n[Contributor Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#overview\r\n[Tree Hygiene]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene\r\n[test-exempt]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#tests\r\n[Flutter Style Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo\r\n[Features we expect every widget to implement]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#features-we-expect-every-widget-to-implement\r\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com/\r\n[flutter/tests]: https://github.com/flutter/tests\r\n[breaking change policy]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#handling-breaking-changes\r\n[Discord]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat\r\n",

If you are running an analysis on Windows and using Python 3.12 or later, the CodeQL Action will switch to running Python 3.11. In this case, if Python 3.11 is not found, then the workflow will fail. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1928\">#1928</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.0 - 06 Oct 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The CodeQL Action now requires CodeQL version 2.10.5 or later.

Currently file coverage information for each of these pairs of languages is grouped together. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1903\">#1903</a></li>\n<li>Add a warning to help customers avoid inadvertently analyzing the same CodeQL language in multiple matrix jobs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1901\">#1901</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.8 - 19 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.10.4 and earlier.

For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.9.5 and 2.10.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.21.7</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Enable the following language aliases when using CodeQL 2.14.4 and later: <code>c-cpp</code> for C/C++ analysis, <code>java-kotlin</code> for Java/Kotlin analysis, and <code>javascript-typescript</code> for JavaScript/TypeScript analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1883\">#1883</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.7 - 14 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1882\">#1882</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.6 - 13 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Better error message when there is a failure to determine the merge base of the code to analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1860\">#1860</a></li>\n<li>Improve the calculation of default amount of RAM used for query execution on GitHub Enterprise Server. This now reduces in proportion to the runner's total memory to better account for system memory usage, helping to avoid out-of-memory failures on larger runners. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1866\">#1866</a></li>\n<li>Enable improved file coverage information for GitHub Enterprise Server users.

        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIn order for `MenuAnchor` menus to be able to not pass on the taps that close their menus, `TapRegion` needed a way to consume them.  This change adds a flag to the `TapRegion`, `consumeOutsideTap` that will consume taps that occur outside of the region if the flag is set (it is false by default). The same flag is added to `MenuAnchor` to allow selecting the behavior for menus.\r\n\r\n`TapRegion` consumes the tap event by registering with the gesture arena and immediately resolving the tap as accepted if any regions in a group have `consumeOutsideTap` set to true.\r\n\r\nThis PR also deprecates `MenuAnchor.anchorTapClosesMenu`, since it is a much more limited version of the same feature that only applied to the anchor itself, and even then only applied to closing the menu, not passing along the tap.  The same functionality can now be implemented by handling a tap on the anchor widget and checking to see if the menu is open before closing it.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/135327\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n - Added tests for `TapRegion` to make sure taps are consumed properly.",

If you are running an analysis on Windows and using Python 3.12 or later, the CodeQL Action will switch to running Python 3.11.

Currently file coverage information for each of these pairs of languages is grouped together. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1903\">#1903</a></li>\n<li>Add a warning to help customers avoid inadvertently analyzing the same CodeQL language in multiple matrix jobs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1901\">#1901</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.8 - 19 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.10.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 12 September 2023 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6, and will be unsupported by the next minor release of the CodeQL Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1884\">#1884</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.10.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.9.5 and 2.10.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.21.7</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Enable the following language aliases when using CodeQL 2.14.4 and later: <code>c-cpp</code> for C/C++ analysis, <code>java-kotlin</code> for Java/Kotlin analysis, and <code>javascript-typescript</code> for JavaScript/TypeScript analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1883\">#1883</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.7 - 14 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1882\">#1882</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.21.6 - 13 Sep 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Better error message when there is a failure to determine the merge base of the code to analysis. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1860\">#1860</a></li>\n<li>Improve the calculation of default amount of RAM used for query execution on GitHub Enterprise Server. This now reduces in proportion to the runner's total memory to better account for system memory usage, helping to avoid out-of-memory failures on larger runners. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1866\">#1866</a></li>\n<li>Enable improved file coverage information for GitHub Enterprise Server users.

        "body": "Fixes https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/134279.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Moves all tests of `--dart-define-from-file` behavior from `build_bundle_test.dart` and `assemble_test.dart` to `flutter_command_test.dart`.\r\n* Deletes a duplicate test of malformed JSON detection behavior.\r\n* Renames the `useDartDefineFromFileOption` method of `FlutterCommand` to `_usesDartDefineFromFileOption`. This 1) makes the name more consistent with the other `uses*Option` methods and 2) hides the method since it is not used outside of the file.\r\n* Renames several tests to better articulate what is under test and what the expected result is.\r\n* Adds a test for the case where a `.env` file with a malformed line is provided to `--dart-define-from-file`.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities.\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement].\r\n- [x] I signed the [CLA].\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt].\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the #hackers-new channel on [Discord].\r\n\r\n<!-- Links -->\r\n[Contributor Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#overview\r\n[Tree Hygiene]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene\r\n[test-exempt]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#tests\r\n[Flutter Style Guide]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo\r\n[Features we expect every widget to implement]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#features-we-expect-every-widget-to-implement\r\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com/\r\n[flutter/tests]: https://github.com/flutter/tests\r\n[breaking change policy]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#handling-breaking-changes\r\n[Discord]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat\r\n",
