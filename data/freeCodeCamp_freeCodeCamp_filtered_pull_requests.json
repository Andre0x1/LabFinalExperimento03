So I decided it was time to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe `textarea` in the accessibility quiz has the same `id` value as the `h2` heading above it. Sometimes duplicate `id`s don't cause an accessibility issue, but in this case it does since the `label` for the `textarea` is pointing to an `id` shared by two elements, which causes ambiguity about which element to use for the `textarea`'s accessible name. And of course, `id`s are supposed to be unique in the first place. So we should probably not have this issue in a course specifically about accessibility :slightly_smiling_face:\r\n\r\nI've added some extra tests to step 40 to make sure they pick a proper `id` for the `textarea`. Basically, it can't contain spaces and it can't already exist. And then I picked a new value for the `id` and updated the remaining steps.",

The current implementation approach uses `position: absolute` and `left: -9999px`, making the elements out of view and resulting a test failure as Playwright is not able to locate the elements. The fix here is to use the existing `sr-only` class, which only adjusts the elements' styles and not position.\r\n- Unblocks #51798 which requires querying and interacting with the input elements.\r\n- Is similar to #51743.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| <img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-12 at 16 32 37\" src=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/assets/25715018/5901b60a-3a9d-43be-ab96-559f3f056f01\"> | <img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-12 at 16 32 04\" src=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/assets/25715018/fde2716d-edfe-4245-8619-d3399d076c46\"> |\r\n\r\n<!-- Feel free to add any additional description of changes below this line -->\r\n",

The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL).  Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark.  The following payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id >> /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine.  The patch introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default.  When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized before processing to avoid a security risk.  Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true` or if it appears that the MarkdownRemark input is attempting to use the Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at

For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed.  If other ranges are required, preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.\n\nWe encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.\n\n### Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Maxwell Garrett of Assetnote for bringing the `__file-code-frame` issue to our attention.\n\n### For more information\n\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com).\n\n---\n\n###

The aim of this PR is to provide some quick urgent fixes that will make these at least usable for screen reader users and people using other assistive tech.\r\n\r\nApparently, the ODIN project MC questions use their own `show.tsx` file to display the MC questions, which I did not realize when I started working on this PR. So this PR only targets MC questions displayed with `video/show.tsx`. Once we have this working the way we want, it shouldn't be too hard to add these fixes to the ODIN project.\r\n\r\n- Remove `aria-label` from `input`. This was causing the accessible name to always be \"Answer\" instead of the text in the `label`. \r\n- Added `for` attribute to `label` since this is a best practice.\r\n- Replaced `video-quiz-input-hidden` class on `input` with `sr-only` since it was merely trying to replicate `sr-only` but not doing it as well as `sr-only` does. Also, `sr-only` might be needed for Playwright tests (see PR #51743).\r\n- Added options to PrismFormatted to use a `span` instead of a `div` and also to suppress giving the code block a role and accessible name. Technically, `div`s are not allowed in a `label` and thus we need PrismFormatted to use a `span`. Giving the code block a role and accessible name inside the `label` was causing NVDA and JAWS to not read the entire `label` text properly.\r\n- Remove the `p` element wrapped around the option text since technically `p` elements should not be in a `label`.\r\n- Add visible focus indicator to the visible radio button. (This one does touch the ODIN project MC questions since they rely on the same CSS.)\r\n",

Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.\n\n    ```ts\n    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;\n    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;\n\n    const currentCode: Code = 0;\n\n    // Create an empty list of subset type\n    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];\n\n    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []\n    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {\n      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode\n    } else {\n      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0\n      currentCode; // -> 2\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.\n\n-   [`4765413`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](https://togithub.com/mefechoel)\n\n    Added the `Map.has` rule.\n\n    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:\n\n    ```ts\n    // BEFORE\n    const userMap = new Map([\n      [\"matt\", 0],\n      [\"sofia\", 1],\n      [2, \"waqas\"],\n    ] as const);\n\n    // Argument of type '\"bryan\"' is not assignable to\n    // parameter of type '\"matt\" | \"sofia\" | \"waqas\"'.\n    userMap.has(\"bryan\");\n    ```\n\n    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.\n\n    ```ts\n    // AFTER\n    import \"@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has\";\n\n    const userMap = new Map([\n      [\"matt\", 0],\n      [\"sofia\", 1],\n      [2, \"waqas\"],\n    ] as const);\n\n    // .has now takes a string as the argument!\n    userMap.has(\"bryan\");\n    ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   [`b15aaa4`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.\n\n### [`v0.4.1`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#041)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"every weekend\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Maybe I should just save in whatever language they took it in. It may be slightly misleading to have users give answers in one language and store their answers in another. The reason I did this is so we can more easily aggregate the responses into relevant info. I could use another opinion on this.\r\n\r\nNote: We need to add the new endpoint to the API project board when this gets merged.\r\n\r\nAlso, note to self - make sure to index the `userId` on the survey collection\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please follow this checklist and put an x in each of the boxes, like this: [x].

The published events may contain security-sensitive data when specific authentication-related commands are executed.\n\nWithout due care, an application may inadvertently expose this sensitive information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default).\n\nThis issue affects the MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7, MongoDB PHP Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.9.2, MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1, MongoDB Node.js Driver 3.6 prior to 3.6.10, MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0 prior to 4.17.0 and MongoDB Node.js Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0. This issue also affects users of the MongoDB C++ Driver dependent on the C driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7 (C++ driver prior to 3.7.0).\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>mongodb/node-mongodb-native (mongodb)</summary>\n\n### [`v4.17.0`](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.17.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/compare/v4.16.0...v4.17.0)\n\nThe MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 4.17.0 of the `mongodb` package!\n\n#### Release Notes\n\n##### `mongodb-js/saslprep` is now installed by default\n\nUntil v6, the driver included the `saslprep` package as an optional dependency for SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication.  `saslprep` breaks when bundled with webpack because it attempted to read a file relative to the package location and consequently the driver would throw errors when using SCRAM-SHA-256 if it were bundled.\n\nThe driver now depends on `mongodb-js/saslprep`, a fork of `saslprep` that can be bundled with webpack because it includes the necessary saslprep data in memory upon loading. This will be installed by default but will only be used if SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication is used.\n\n##### Remove credential availability on `ConnectionPoolCreatedEvent`\n\nIn order to avoid mistakenly printing credentials the `ConnectionPoolCreatedEvent` will replace the credentials option with an empty object. The credentials are still accessble via MongoClient options: `client.options.credentials`.\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **NODE-5272:** do not create or drop ecc collections ([#&#8203;3678](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3678)) ([d26ad61](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/d26ad6166ae58c9976770eec84f32f9c2c17a0f3))\n-   **NODE-5398:** use mongodb-js/saslprep instead of saslprep ([#&#8203;3820](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3820)) ([5244711](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/5244711723cc7b05c50dac6ba4b7363b5af2ac37))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **NODE-5262:** AWS Lambda metadata detection logic is too permissive ([#&#8203;3683](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3683)) ([c0c3d99](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/c0c3d99784fc487f1cbe0eb02a63c58a1242d872))\n-   **NODE-5311:** construct error messages for AggregateErrors in Node16+ ([#&#8203;3683](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3683)) ([98b7bdf](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/98b7bdf2d6c08ba9470bbda0fad3251ea0a08949))\n-   **NODE-5316:** prevent parallel topology creation in MongoClient.connect ([#&#8203;3696](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3696)) ([e13038d](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/e13038d1c7246e95b32993fc97331713b542fd74))\n    -   Thank you [@&#8203;clemclx](https://togithub.com/clemclx) for contributing this fix! \ud83c\udf89\n-   **NODE-5356:** prevent scram auth from throwing TypeError if saslprep is not a function ([#&#8203;3732](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3732)) ([2d028af](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/2d028af31d17a25a16c1ef73749a266fe7cf3a33))\n-   **NODE-5536:** remove credentials from ConnectionPoolCreatedEvent options ([#&#8203;3812](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3812)) ([2910dca](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/2910dcae38ce29e0ee5afc497ac146de2a4bb984))\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/current/)\n-   [API](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.17/)\n-   [Changelog](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/v4.17.0/HISTORY.md)\n\nWe invite you to try the `mongodb` library immediately, and report any issues to the [NODE project](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/NODE).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

Only tabs should be in the tablist. Also, when focus is on a tab, the `Tab` key should put focus on its associated tabpanel, or the first focusable element in the tabpanel if appropriate. Having the preview pane toggle button in the tablist put it in the tab order between the tabs and the tabpanels and thus if either the code or console tab had focus, hitting `Tab` would put focus on the toggle button instead of the tabpanel. See my original PR #50961 for a more in depth discussion.\r\n- Due to the `forceMount` property on the Preview tab, the Preview tabpanel was not being hidden properly when it was not active and thus it was navigable to screen readers when it shouldn't have been. I manually added the `hidden` property to the Preview tab when it is not active. We could also solve this using CSS `display: none` but I went with the `hidden` attribute since that's what the other tabpanels are using.\r\n- I cleaned up the CSS a little.",

Adds titles to non-decorative SVGs in order to fix WCAG SC 1.1 violations https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html\r\n    - **Why?** Inline SVGs are treated similar to images by assistive tech, currently on the home page the displayed company logos are read like \"Since 2014, more than 40,000 freeCodeCamp.org graduates have gotten jobs at tech companies including: image, image, image, image, image\" on mac/chrome/VO which does not convey the intended meaning.\r\n2. Adds explicit role='img' to svgs in order to prevent focus of svg elements\r\n    - **Why?** Adding an explicit role of img will let screen readers know to treat the inline SVG as one image object, this leads to a more consistent experience across screen readers since certain browser/SR combinations will focus each individual element in the SVG which is an annoying user experience.\r\n3. Fixes AmazonLogo title and component name which was named SpotifyLogo likely due to copy and pasting the code / forgetting to change.\r\n4. As a bonus this will also fix the patreon donate link not having discernible text (WCAG 2.1 AA violation) since the patreon logo SVG was used in that link w/o any other content. When links have no accessible alts or text SRs will try their best to convey the meaning to the user, this can be very annoying since they will potentially read out long URLs or other attributes that don't mean anything to the user.",

We\u2019ve been working on a few projects that will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the upcoming releases for updates!\n\n#### Improvements and bug fixes\n\nWe made the following changes:\n\n##### Prisma Client improvements\n\n-   Validation for `undefined` values in arrays in `Json` fields\n    We added runtime validation for `undefined` values in arrays in `Json` fields. Prisma Client will now return an error when an array contains an `undefined` value. Therefore, we encourage you to add validation that either removes the value or transforms it to `null` if you stumble on the runtime validation:\n\n```ts\n// Query\nawait prisma.user.findMany({\n where: {\n   // JSON field\n   preferences: [undefined, '\"theme\": \"dark\"', null, ]\n }\n})\n\n// Example error message on running the query\nCan not use `undefined` value within array. Use `null` or filter out `undefined` values\n```\n\n-   Performance improvements for models with many unique fields\n\nThis release improves Prisma Client\u2019s memory consumption for models with many `@unique` constraints. This was a regression from version 4.10.1, where in some cases, if a model had many unique constraints, Prisma Client would use up a lot of available memory.\n\n-   Fixed the segmentation fault error that used to occur on ARM64 Linux binary targets\n-   Metrics Preview feature improvements:\n    -   We updated the counters and gauge properties\n    -   We fixed the bug that caused the `prisma_pool_connections_open` metric to have a negative value in some cases.\n\n##### Prisma Migrate improvements\n\n-   Fixed an introspection bug for MongoDB views. Previously, if a MongoDB database contained a view, `prisma db pull` would throw an error. We resolved this, and views are now ignored.\n-   Added the `PRISMA_SCHEMA_DISABLE_ADVISORY_LOCK` environment variable that enables you to disable [advisory locking](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/migrate-development-production#advisory-locking).\n\n##### [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) improvements\n\n-   Added support for rendering multi-line comments in tooltips when hovering on a block.\n-   Improved the auto-completion for composite types in other blocks.\n-   Added a Code Action that allows you to replace `SetDefault` with `NoAction` when using MySQL and the default/`foreignKeys` relation mode.\n\n#### Fixes and improvements\n\n##### Prisma Migrate\n\n-   [Percona-XtraDB-Cluster prohibits use of GET_LOCK with pxc_strict_mode = ENFORCING](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16020)\n-   [MongoDB views should be ignored introspecting the database](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16179)\n-   [Error in Connector on MongoDB executing listIndex: \"system.views\"](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17006)\n-   [`prisma migrate deploy`: `MariaDB doesn't yet support 'GET_LOCK in cluster (WSREP_ON=ON)'`](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19350)\n\n##### Prisma Client\n\n-   [Remove all special cases for Data Proxy in our tests](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16101)\n-   [Segmentation fault on ARM64 Linux](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18510)\n-   [In the metrics feature a gauge & counter are swapped](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18760)\n-   [The prisma metrics `prisma_pool_connections_open` has a bug where it goes negative](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18761)\n-   [Prisma crashes with GraphQL queries of nested one-to-many relationship](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18787)\n-   [P1017 Server has closed the connection on linux_arm64](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19209)\n-   [`Error: socket hang up` on Linux/arm64](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19419)\n-   [Panic in Query Engine with SIGABRT signal (Debian Bookworm, engineType = binary)](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19743)\n-   [Prisma 5 drops `undefined` from Arrays when using Json fields with Postgres](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20325)\n-   [Suspected memory leak in Lambda function after upgrading from 4.10.1](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20799)\n-   [Error when generating - No unsupported field should reach that path](https://togithub.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20986)\n\n##### Language tools (e.g. VS Code)\n\n-   [Models with multi line comments only show last line in tooltip](https://togithub.com/prisma/language-tools/issues/861)\n-   [Add VS Code quick fix / code action to replace `SetDefault` with `NoAction` when `provider = \"mysql\"` and `relationMode = \"foreignKeys\" | default`](https://togithub.com/prisma/language-tools/issues/1286)\n-   [Composite Types aren't offered as being auto-completable in other blocks](https://togithub.com/prisma/language-tools/issues/1495)\n\n#### Credits\n\nHuge thanks to [@&#8203;alencardc](https://togithub.com/alencardc), [@&#8203;Oreilles](https://togithub.com/Oreilles), [@&#8203;christianledgard](https://togithub.com/christianledgard), [@&#8203;skyzh](https://togithub.com/skyzh), [@&#8203;alula](https://togithub.com/alula), [@&#8203;michaelpoellath](https://togithub.com/michaelpoellath), [@&#8203;RobertCraigie](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie), [@&#8203;stephenwade](https://togithub.com/stephenwade) for helping!\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"every weekend\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about these updates again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

The `Decimal128` constructor and `fromString()` methods now throw when detecting a loss of precision (more than 34 significant digits). We also expose a new `fromStringWithRounding()` method which restores the previous rounding behaviour.\n\nSee the [bson v5.5.0 release notes](https://togithub.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v5.5.0) for more information.\n\n##### Use region settings for STS AWS credentials request\n\nWhen using [IAM AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html) AWS authentication the driver uses the [@&#8203;aws-sdk/credential-providers](https://togithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) package to contact the Security Token Service API for temporary credentials. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build-in redundancy, and increase session token validity. Unfortunately, environment variables `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS` and `AWS_REGION` do not directly control the region the SDK's STS client contacts for credentials.\n\nThe driver now has added support for detecting these variables and setting the appropriate options when calling the SDK's API: [fromNodeProviderChain()](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-credential-providers/#fromNodeProviderChain).\n\n> \\[!IMPORTANT]\n> The driver will only set region options if **BOTH** environment variables are present. `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS` **MUST** be set to either `'legacy'` or `'regional'`, and `AWS_REGION` must be set.\n\n##### Fix memory leak with ChangeStreams\n\nIn a previous release, 5.7.0, we refactored cursor internals from callbacks to async/await. In particular, the `next` function that powers cursors was written with callbacks and would recursively call itself depending on the cursor type. For `ChangeStreams`, this function would call itself if there were no new changes to return to the user. After converting that code to async/await each recursive call created a new promise that saved the current async context. This would slowly build up memory usage if no new changes came in to unwind the recursive calls.\n\nThe function is now implemented as a loop, memory leak be gone!\n\n##### Features\n\n-   **NODE-5564:** bump bson version to ^5.5.0 ([#&#8203;3865](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3865)) ([dc110e0](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/dc110e002e8194b9881a8c2aa140a8ce95f344c0))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **NODE-5550:** set AWS region from environment variable for STSClient ([#&#8203;3851](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3851)) ([2fab06b](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/2fab06b2bdf019a0924fda24d6a81565350c28d6))\n-   **NODE-5587:** recursive calls to next cause memory leak ([#&#8203;3842](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/3842)) ([f60f1b5](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/f60f1b5f12522b32ea34a4db8cf750718f53e8b9))\n\n#### Documentation\n\n-   [Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/current/)\n-   [API](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.9/)\n-   [Changelog](https://togithub.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/v5.9.0/HISTORY.md)\n\nWe invite you to try the `mongodb` library immediately, and report any issues to the [NODE project](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/NODE).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"every weekend\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n\u267b **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n\ud83d\udd15 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).
