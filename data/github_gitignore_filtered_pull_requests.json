        "body": "Hey team, long time listener, first time caller..\r\n\r\n**Reasons for making this change:**\r\n\r\nHere is the original pattern:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**/.terraform/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, let's look at that glob at the end - the `/*` part. You cannot commit an empty folder to git, so ignoring `<path>/*` is analogous to ignoring `<path>`. In both cases, you will ignore the folder and its contents. I cannot think of an example where ignoring `**/.terraform/` would produce a different result than ignoring `**/.terraform/*`.\r\n\r\nNext, what about that glob at the front (that's the `**` part)? The gitignore documentation says:\r\n\r\n> If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular .gitignore file itself. **Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level below the .gitignore level**.\r\n\r\nEmphasis mine. In other words, the glob at the beginning is necessary to ignore `.terraform` folders below the root of the repo if and only if we leave the glob at the end, which serves no purpose. By removing the glob at the end, the rule is applied \"at any level below the .gitignore level\", and thus has no need for the recursive `**` glob at the beginning.\r\n\r\n**Links to documentation supporting these rule changes:**\r\n\r\n- <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>\r\n\r\n",

Using gitignore files\r\nare a basic part of my job and process. I rely upon the gitignore file to keep out of my local Git repositories and my and our \r\nremote Git repositories on GitHub, files and/or folders which should not be in Git repos.\r\n\r\nI am involved in migrating several Team Foundation Server (TFS) repos from on old on-prem TFS server, to repos in a new\r\norganization associated with my work. We are using the utilitiy `git-tfs` to migrate our TFS projects and repos to GitHub. Many of the TFS Projects have multiple Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repos within them. I have found that the VisualStudio.gitignore file does not take multiple Visual Studio (VS) solutions into consideration. Working with any VS solution in a migrated repo will result in adding .obj and .dll/.exe files to sub-VS solutions when performing a Git commit. I am certain that others who must migrate TFS Projects containing multiple TFVC repos, into one repo in a GitHub repo using `git-tfs`, will encounter the same issue that we have. Therefore, I propose the change to the VisualStudio.gitignore file, to handle when an obj or bin folder is not in the place that the current VisualStudio.gitignore file considers those folders to be in.\r\n\r\n_TODO_\r\n\r\nI consulted the official Git web site on the [Gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).\r\n\r\n_TODO_\r\n\r\nIf this is a new template:\r\n\r\nThis is not a new template but is a proposed modification of the **VisualStudio.gitignore** template.\r\n",

Unity will automatically delete the orphaned meta files, and those deletes also tend to get committed. The importer auto-adds and commits them again, and the cycle goes on and on until someone like me gets fed up.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that inconsistency by adding the `*.unitypackage.meta` to the ignore list.",

This could cause errors. Otherwise, without errors, the catkin build command, creates the path to match the existing local workspace structure.

I therefore think it would be good to have this included so that this mistake is not carried though. Especially since the .DS_Store is a hidden file and many people do not think about its existence and therefore it can be hard to miss.
