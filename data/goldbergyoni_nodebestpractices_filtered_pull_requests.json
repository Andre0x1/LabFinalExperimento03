So I created an svg template with a clip path that you can load up in most tools that support svg and export with transparency.\r\nI also added SVGs for the icons used in committee section, since those also look kind of funky in in other themes.\r\nWhile messing with things I discovered that adding `min-width` to the contributor template somehow still affects the profile images even though it gets sanitized away, so I added that so that there's a lot less shifting of the contributors table.\r\n\r\nI probably need to revert it, but I was curious if there's any reason the README's for the other languages aren't included in the automated contributors updates?",
