I'm new to how reveal.js works, so the event listeners for updating the fragments/notes are probably in the wrong place, but I thought I'd send this little tweak upstream just in case it helps. This makes the sidebar speaker notes shown with \"showNotes: true\" step through the notes in fragments. Hope it's useful!\r\n\r\nRelated to:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/f496613dd3309a3066642adf1261e9da0578cdda\r\n- https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1636",

And this makes a lot of files even in the base reveal.js project (node_modules is not excluded \ud83d\ude30).\r\n\r\nThis crawling seems quite useless because this task is not responsible for the watch, all it does is telling the browser to refresh. Still, the `connect.reload()` API needs a stream of files to execute (I tried many ways to launch it without `gulp.src(...)` before with no success). \r\nSince the src stream is irrelevant, I made `gulp.src` only crawl the original `index.html` file, and everything works fine : when modifying a file, even if it's not the base `index.html` file, the browser refreshes instantly, and shows every modifications made.\r\n\r\nHere is an approximative bench on my dev computer (macbook pro M1Pro, RAM 32Go), measuring time from file save, to modification shown in browser (may differ from timing showed in terminal) :\r\n- old config : 1000-3000ms, **thousands** (!!!) of network request fired from the browser (all cancelled) \ud83d\ude31  \r\n- new config : 10-50ms, no additional network requests \ud83e\udd73 ",

They're based on your `black.scss` and `white.scss`, with modifications\r\n- headers are verbatim (rather than in CAPITAL CASE) - useful when the words/terms are in CamelCase or mixed;\r\n- compact (less spacing) - using the screen more;\r\n- high contrast (pure black on pure white, and vice-versa).\r\n\r\nThis would help my existing presentation (https://peter-kehl.github.io/no_std_rust_libs = https://github.com/peter-kehl/no_std_rust_libs) and 18+ more presentations to come (https://github.com/peter-kehl/no_std_patterns).\r\n\r\nCould there be a better way to organize/centralize the code shared between `black.scss` and `black_contrast_compact_verbatim_headers.scss` (and between `white.scss` and `white_contrast_compact_verbatim_headers.scss`), please do as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance either way.

Here is an example of the permissions in one of the workflow runs:\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/actions/runs/3117848498/jobs/5056764467#step:1:19\n\nAfter this change, the scopes will be reduced to the minimum needed for the following workflow:\n\n- js.yml\n\n\n### Motivation and Context\n\n- This is a security best practice, so if the GITHUB_TOKEN is compromised due to a vulnerability or compromised Action, the damage will be reduced.\n- [GitHub recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token) defining minimum GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.\n- The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) also treats not setting token permissions as a high-risk issue. This change will help increase the Scorecard score for this repository.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ashish Kurmi <akurmi@stepsecurity.io>",

This parent-styling should also be implemented on the revealjs.com pages.\r\n\r\nIt does not fix the 'remote button' issue (as discussed in that same issue), because that will need either an event listener on fullscreen changes (which is not built in (yet)), or the possibility to both focus the target deck AND simulate an F keypress at the same time.",

        "body": "This PR implements both `data-auto-animate-id` and `data-auto-animate-restart`, allowing for finer control of auto animate.\r\n\r\n* When at least one of two successive `data-auto-animate` slides has a `data-auto-animate-id` attribute, both need to have the same attribute value in order for auto animate to trigger\r\n* When a `data-auto-animate` slide has a `data-auto-animate-restart` attribute, auto animate does not trigger on the transition between the previous slide and it, but _does_ trigger on the transition between it and the next slide. `data-auto-animate-restart` always negatively overrides auto animate, even breaking two slides with the same `data-auto-animate-id` apart. Note that \"previous\" and \"next\" are meant physically, so \"previous\" always means a slide to the left or the top of the current one and \"next\" always means a slide to the right or the bottom instead of \"previously shown slide\" and \"next slide to show\" (which might go in any direction, breaking `data-auto-animate-restart` which isn't symmetric)\r\n\r\nThis design is rather flexible and doesn't introduce a breaking change (apart from new attribute names being used by reveal.js): `data-auto-animate` slide pairs without `data-auto-animate-id` and `data-auto-animate-restart` behave just like before\r\n\r\nWhy both `data-auto-animate-id` and `data-auto-animate-restart`, wouldn't one be enough?\r\nIn theory yes, but I think having both is handy. Only `data-auto-animate-restart` would result in an unreadable hell for any non-trivial presentations with multiple auto-animate groups right next to each other and requires a lot of attention to not accidentally mess up the exact break points. While only having `data-auto-animate-id` would require annotating possibly two dozen slides with a different id when all you want is one simple auto animate break in the middle.\r\n\r\nExamples: (Slide pairs with different letters won't auto animate)\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate>A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>A2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-restart>B1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>B2</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>B1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>B2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"c\">C1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"c\">C2</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"b\">B1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"b\">B2</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"1\">A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"1\">A2</section>\r\n<section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\">Vertical B1</section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\">Vertical B2</section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\" data-auto-animate-restart>Vertical C1</section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\">Vertical C2</section>\r\n</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>D1</section>\r\n<section>E1</section>\r\n```",

When using r-stretch the image should be resized vertically that the whole slide is covered. However, having a landscape formated image, this is not possible. In order to achive that the whole slide is covered, I would suppose to add a top and bottom padding to the image. This pull request extends the `layoutSlideContents()` method and adds an appropriate padding to landscape images. \r\n\r\nIn the following zip file one can find an example index.html together with a portrait picuture and a landscape picture.\r\n[reveal.js.zip](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/files/5558494/reveal.js.zip)\r\n\r\nThis pull request also contains the fix of a minor bug  within the `getRemainingHeight()` method from utils.js. Without this bug fix it may happen in some cases that the image height is accidentally set to 0.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it would be great to define a more detailed custom layout by editing the `layoutSlideContents()` method. However, digging into the reveal.js file and making your custom changes is not very convinient. I think it would be a great feature if there exists the possiblitiy to inject a custom layout method through the reveal configuration. Maybe it is possible to think of such a feature in the future.",

It's not ready to merge just yet, but it's getting close.\r\n\r\nThe main changes in this release are:\r\n- New website, docs and logo https://revealjs.com\r\n- Modernized reveal.js core. The old reveal.js file with 6.2k lines of code (!) was refactored and split into ES modules.\r\n- You can now run multiple reveal.js presentations on the same page.  \r\n  ```javascript\r\n  import Reveal from 'reveal.js'\r\n  let deck1 = new Reveal( document.querySelector( '.deck1' ) );\r\n  let deck2 = new Reveal( document.querySelector( '.deck2' ) );\r\n  deck1.initialize({ embedded: true });\r\n  deck2.initialize({ embedded: true });\r\n  ```\r\n- Converted all plugins to ES modules so that they can be bundled with reveal.js.\r\n- All plugins and reveal.js core are transpiled to ES5 for situations where you need to support older browsers.\r\n- Switched build systems from grunt to gulp (using rollup for bundling).\r\n- Added a major new Auto-Animate feature.\r\n- Added a new `slidetransitionend` event.\r\n- `Reveal.add/removeEventListener` -> `Reveal.on/off`.\r\n- Added support for code line numbers and highlights using Markdown\r\n- The initialize method now returns a promise that resolves when reveal.js has started ```Reveal.initialize().then( () => console.log( 'ready' ) )```.\r\n- The highlight.js and marked libraries are now installed from npm. They were previously hard coded inside their corresponding plugins in this repository.\r\n\r\nThere are a few breaking changes in this release:\r\n- All compiled assets (reveal.js, reveal.css, themes) have moved to /dist.\r\n- Print stylesheets are now baked into the reveal.css file so there is no need to separately include them in the presentation HTML.\r\n- The multiplex and server side speakers notes plugins have moved out to separate repos and can be installed via npm:\r\n  https://github.com/reveal/multiplex \r\n  https://github.com/reveal/notes-server\r\n\r\nDocs, upgrade instructions and a new revealjs.com will follow when it's ready to merge but hopefully this gives you an idea of what's to come! \u270c\ufe0f",

The pacing timer will then continue to allocate the exact pacing time for slides that do have `data-timing` set, as before. However, rather than applying the `defaultTiming` constant to all others, it will\r\n\r\n- Add up the time already allocated to slides via `data-timing`;\r\n- subtract that from totalTime;\r\n- divide the difference by the number of slides *without* `data-timing` set;\r\n- apply the thus-calculated average to those slides.\r\n\r\n`totalTime` has no default, and if both `defaultTiming` and `totalTime` are set, `totalTime wins`. This preserves backward compatibility: if a presenter has set `defaultTiming` and updates reveal.js, `totalTime` will be `null` and `defaultTiming` is still applied to all slides without a `data-timing` attribute. The presenter can then switch to the automatic calculation, if desired, by setting a value for `totalTime`.\r\n",

It also adjusts the notes plugin accordingly to have correct equations in speaker notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Why\r\n\r\nCommonHTML (or CHTML) is the default renderer of MathJax since version 2.6, the current version being 2.7.5. Reveal still uses the \"old\" HTML-CSS renderer. The rendered equations of the CHTML renderer, however, are more consistent/similar across different browsers, and in some cases even more correct. \r\n\r\nFor instance, compare old/new for this equation:\r\n$$\\{\\overrightarrow{S}\\rightarrow\\overrightarrow{L},\\overleftarrow{S}\\rightarrow\\overleftarrow{L},\\overleftarrow{L}\\rightarrow\\overleftarrow{L}\\overrightarrow{S},\\overleftarrow{L}\\rightarrow\\overleftarrow{S}\\overrightarrow{L}\\}$$\r\n\r\n\r\n# How\r\n\r\n- Select latest MathJax and CHTML configuration as default\r\n- Disable MathJax' matchFontHeight, since this causes problems (for old and new renderer)\r\n- Disable typesetting on slideChange, since it is no longer required\r\n- When exporting a PDF: Use the new promise mechanism to ensure that math typesetting is finished before emitting the 'ready' signal. Otherwise, complex presentations with complex equations end up having some non-typeset equations in the PDF.\r\n- In the speaker notes plugin, the main presentation send the location of the MathJax script to the speaker notes window, which loads the correct MathJax script and then has the correct math fonts.\r\n- Disable AssistiveMML in MathJax configuration, since this setting erroneously duplicates all equations in speaker notes.\r\n\r\n# Fixed Issues\r\n\r\nBesides switching to the better (more consistent and more correct) math renderer, this pull request fixes the following open issues:\r\n- 1924: Now works thanks to the new reset.css and the disabled matchFontHeight.\r\n- 2105: This problem was caused by dynamically adjusting font height and by re-typesetting upon slide-change. Both can now safely be disabled.\r\n- 1383: This problem was caused by re-typesetting math content on slide changes in overview mode. Both are disabled now.\r\n- 1726: Disabling AssistiveMML removes duplicated math in notes.\r\n- 2256: Solved by enforcing math is typeset in init() function through promises.\r\n\r\nI'm using the CommonHTML renderer for math-heavy teaching for about a year now, and it works like a charm. I think it should be used simply because it has been the default choice of MathJax for quite some time. One particular benefit of the more consistent math typesetting is that manual annotation (using a pimped version of the chalkboard plugin) now match the precise location of math terms across different browsers. Let me know if I should prepare slides demonstrating before/after of the above issues.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMario",

Use `config.controls` to control whether or not the button is shown.\r\n2. Let the entire `dom.pauseOverlay` listen for clicks and close when clicked.\r\n\r\nThis is just one way you could approach this. You could also introduce a new config for the button, but I thought it made good sense to use the `controls`.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.",

        "body": "reveal.js' intent is to map section elements into slides. It assumes that the document contains at most two levels of sections. Level 2 section elements, if any, become vertical slides. Having more than two section levels prevents reveal.js to properly identify slides and breaks layout, navigation, slide counting and so on.\r\n\r\nHaving sections in vertical slides can be very handy to identify semantical parts in slides and adapt their presentation with css. This is particularly useful when producing reveal.js slides from markdown if you can provide an id or classes to the sections. pandoc, for example, let you do this: with option `--section-divs`, pandoc \"wraps sections in `<section>` tags and attach identifiers to the enclosing `<section>` rather than the header itself\" (see example below).\r\n\r\nWith this PR, sections with a level greater than two are just ignored.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n### Source\r\n\r\n    # Stack 1\r\n\r\n    ## Vertical slide 1\r\n\r\n    ### A Section\r\n\r\n    Content\r\n\r\n    ### A Section{.ofSomeClass}\r\n\r\n    Content\r\n\r\n    ## Vertical slide 2\r\n\r\n    ## Vertical slide 3\r\n\r\n    # Horizontal slide\r\n\r\n### Produced html\r\n\r\n(excerpt, some classes and identifiers removed)\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"reveal\">\r\n      <div class=\"slides\">\r\n        <section>\r\n          <section>\r\n            <h1>Stack 1</h1>\r\n          </section>\r\n          <section>\r\n            <h2>Vertical slide 1</h2>\r\n            <section>\r\n              <h3>A Section</h3>\r\n              <p>Content</p> \r\n            </section>\r\n            <section class=\"ofSomeClass\">\r\n              <h3>A Section</h3>\r\n              <p>Content</p>\r\n            </section>\r\n          </section>\r\n          <section>\r\n            <h2>Vertical slide 2</h2>\r\n          </section>\r\n          <section>\r\n            <h2>Vertical slide 3</h2>\r\n          </section>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <section>\r\n          <section>\r\n            <h1>Horizontal slide</h1>\r\n          </section>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n",

This PR greatly improves that by optionally including the current fragment index in the URL, so that you only have to click around if you're changing the fragment order (similarly to how you have to click around if you add/remove slides).\r\n\r\nThis is hidden behind a new configuration option `fragmentInURL` (default `false`), since not everyone will want fragments cluttering up their browser history (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/228#issuecomment-10261098).\r\n  \r\nThis has been requested a couple of times: #228, #1125, #1919. By putting it behind a configuration option, I think it makes life much nicer for people using livereload while also not changing things at all for those who don't want it.\r\n  ",
