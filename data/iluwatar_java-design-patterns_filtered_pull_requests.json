Here are the main features included in this pull request:\r\n\r\n- Enhanced Money Operations: Added the Money, Currency, and Accounts class to manipulate money across different accounts and currencies. The App class acts as an entry point to depict how the classes function.\r\n\r\n- Testing: UnitTests have been provided for each of the interacting classes.\r\n\r\n- README.md: Has the relevant information regarding definitions and use cases for the pattern.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to allow for the use of the Money design pattern within the java-design-patterns repository. We believe that these changes will improve the overall user experience and understanding of the pattern.\r\n\r\nFor further details on the changes made, please refer to the individual commits in this pull request.\r\n\r\nContributors and maintainers, please review this pull request, provide feedback, and suggest any further improvements.

It addresses issue #1.\r\n\r\nMain Changes:\r\n1; Added ProxyHandler interface to define before and after method invocation behavior.\r\n2; Created the DynamicProxyChain class to manage dynamic proxy chains and handle method invocations.\r\n3; Added a static method in DynamicProxyChain for creating proxy instances.\r\n4; Implemented a sample use case with a MyService class and a LoggingHandler for method call logging.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n1; This implementation serves as a basic example of the Dynamic Proxy Chain Pattern for logging. It can be extended and \r\n   customized to add more complex cross-cutting concerns.\r\n2; Developers can use this pattern to separate concerns and improve code maintainability in various scenarios.\r\n3; Please review and provide feedback on the code structure and usage.\r\n4; Further enhancements and customizations can be made based on specific project requirements.\r\n",

CacheStore contained a lot of methods which can be pushed down to child classes.\r\n> 2. To make it more cohesive, I divided the class into two more classes: CacheStoreRead, CacheStoreWrite.\r\n> 3. This way the code can be considered more extensible.\r\n\r\n- Design patter: Commander\r\n- Refactoring method: Decompose conditional\r\n- Changes:\r\n> 1. The if conditional added complexity to the already complex method.\r\n> 2. I took out the if condition and put it in another method, reducing the complexity a little bit.\r\n\r\n- Design pattern: Domainmodel\r\n- Refactoring method: Extract class\r\n- Changes:\r\n> 1. There were a lot of responsibilities handled by the class 'Customer'.\r\n> 2. I made a separate class called 'Account' which will handle all the customer's account details.\r\n> 3. Class 'Customer' contains its 'Account'.\r\n\r\n- Design pattern: intercepting-filter\r\n- Refactoring method:pull-up method\r\n- Changes:\r\n> 1. All the child classes of 'Abstract Filter' implements execute method, and they are following a pattern.\r\n> 2. We can create a template of this function in 'Abstract Filter', and force child classes to implemented helper method used in the template.\r\n\r\n- Design pattern: typeobject\r\n- Refactoring method: extract method\r\n- Changes:\r\n> 1. Some blocks of code in method 'round' in class 'CandyGame' can be taken out.\r\n> 2. Three more functions were created to reduce complexity of function.\r\n> 3. Changes will make it more testable.\r\n\r\n- Design pattern: balking\r\n- Refactoring method: Introducing explaining variable\r\n- Changes:\r\n> 1. The variable with value '50' was directly used.\r\n> 2. Introduced variable with explaining names.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- There was one test which was failing at the time i forked the repository.\r\n> Design pattern: dirty-flag\r\n- All the other tests are passing.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I need to make any further changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Renamed and refactored them accordingly. \r\n- Line space before attributes (such as @param) in the JavaDoc comment section.\r\n- Remove linespaces between import statements.\r\n- Adding space (' ') between semicolons in the loop, bring logical operators (such as &&) in new lines. Checkstyles related to formatting in general.\r\n\r\n**Note ->**\r\nAdded `<suppress checks=\"RequireEmptyLineBeforeBlockTagGroup\" files=\".*\\.java\"/>` in the suppressions. \r\nThis is to ignore line space requirement on the JavaDoc section. \r\n\r\nThere are two reasons behind this new suppression rule:\r\n1) Need to change 300+ files for this minor checkstyle condition.\r\n2) When we press \"enter\" while in JavaDoc comment section, all IDEs (tested on Vscode & IntelliJ) insert a space and then goes to next line. So, maven think that it is on the same line and will result in checkstyle error. This will create some confusion to people while resolving the checkstyle issues. \r\n\r\nFor me, this is not super important and unnecessary . But, if you think, it is required, then let me know. I will then go ahead and make those changes. \r\n\r\nSorry about the multiple commits as there was an existing `etc/` directory which was removed in the checkin and I added it back. Also, there was a  file `FileSelectorJFrame.java`  that was renamed to `FileSelectorJframe.java`  in favor of checkstyle. But it wasn't checked-in for some strange reason. I fixed that as well. ",

This makes it easy to add new rules without changing the rest of the system (applying the Open/Closed Principle).\r\nWith this in mind, we implement the pattern by having an imaginary country that has an immigration policy with multiple criteria. We create a separate class for each criterion to implement the pattern to calculate the candidate's immigration score.\r\n\r\n* A directory called Rule Engine Design Pattern has been added to present the implementation of the pattern, built based on the instruction https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/wiki/01.-How-to-contribute. \r\n",
