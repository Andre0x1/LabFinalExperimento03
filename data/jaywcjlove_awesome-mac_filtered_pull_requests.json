It ensures your device's operational security by automatically initiating either a system shutdown or hibernation if an unauthorized device connects or a connected device is unplugged. It offers the flexibility to whitelist designated devices, to select an action to be executed and to set a countdown timer, allowing to disarm the shutdown process. It's a revival of the well-known [usbkill project](https://github.com/hephaest0s/usbkill) by hephaestos, but with a Graphical User Interface and added functionality.\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the CONTRIBUTING guide\r\n- [x] I have explained why this PR is important\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Further Comments\r\n\r\nFor non-technical user, using the original usbkill command line tool (see above) is far too difficult. This is the reason for swiftGuard: It offers a nice, clean and intuitive Interface with some additional features, whitelisting and an active development (unlike usbkill, which seems abandoned).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Interface](https://github.com/Lennolium/swiftGuard/raw/main/img/screenshots/screenshots.png)\r\n\r\n",

As an engineer, I usually save all my deeplinks to Apple Notes, then whenever I want to run them, I have to copy and paste them to the terminal and run it. This takes many steps, and lots of them can be reduced. So this app helps you manage all deeplinks, and list out all available simulators so you can select the deeplink, then select the simulator, and press Run. Very simple and intuitive.\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPut an x in the boxes once you've completed each step. You can also fill these out after creating the PR.

It's faster, leaner, and shipping today! It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2). It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero \"CPU Wakes\", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features.\r\n\r\nMailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock with a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton of email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company profiles. All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send your email credentials to the cloud.\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the CONTRIBUTING guide\r\n- [x] I have explained why this PR is important\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Mailspring Graphic](https://getmailspring.com/static/img/hero_graphic_mac@2x.png)\r\n",

Each snippet has fragments - tabs, which gives even greater level of organization.\r\n\r\n**Editor**\r\nA snippet manager must not only provide organization of snippets but also have a good code editor. That's why under the hood of massCode there's Ace. Ace is a high performance code editor which supports syntax highlighting for over 170 languages. We also added a Prettier to code formatter.\r\n\r\n**Markdown**\r\nmassCode allows you to write in Markdown and provide support to syntax highlighting, tables, list and other formatting. Also massCode supports Mermaid - diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.\r\n\r\n**Integrations**\r\nmassCode supports extensions for VS Code, Raycast and Alfred, which gives even more possibilities to use application. With the VS Code extension you get practically zen mode, search for the necessary snippets and insert them immediately or save the selected code sections as a snippet.\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPut an x in the boxes once you've completed each step.

I made an app that includes the built-in color picker, but also adds lots of extra features, like quick copy to Hex, HSL, RGB, etc, keyboard shortcuts, color history, you can use it as a menu bar app or normal app, and many more features. The app has become quite popular (100+ ratings with 4.9/5 average).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sindresorhus/System-Color-Picker\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPut an x in the boxes once you've completed each step.

After discovering this awesome list, I read all kinds of interesting items in the entire list. After that, I wanted to see what updates were made to this list every once in a while, and had to go through Github's commit history to see what was updated for each commit. To be honest, it was quite a poor reading experience.\r\n\r\nSo for this need, I created [Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com) in my spare time, and created a profile for awesome-mac, https://www.trackawesomelist.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac/ . With this link, we can read the latest updates of awesome-mac by day/week, daily updated. I wonder if anyone else has this need to see the latest updates, and if so, whether to add this badge link somewhere in the readme to tell others they can see the updates via this link?\r\n\r\n[![Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/badge.svg)](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac/)\r\n\r\nThere are also some other awesome repos like [awesome-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue), [free-for-dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev), [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#related) that have added this badge or link.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. I'm happy to receive any feedback or suggestions for improvement. I want this to be as useful as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR Checklist\r\n\r\nPut an x in the boxes once you've completed each step.

I really appreciate you maintaining such an awesome list. I like this list.\r\n\r\n",

The grammar and style is a bit off. I cleaned it up to keep its original and intended meaning (although I am not sure what is meant by the repo becoming \"different\"). It could be rewritten entirely, but I wanted to go ahead and work with what is currently there. I would love input from @jaywcjlove on this matter.\r\n\r\nI renamed `contributing.md` to `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The rename fits the style of the other files (`README.md`, `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`).\r\n\r\nRegardless if the rename is accepted, the contributing guidelines should probably be linked in the README.",
