I look forward to diving into it personally.\r\n\r\nI noticed while reviewing the `README.md` that there are still references to the `master` branch, despite it having been renamed to `main` in this repository (and some others of yours that are also mentioned in the guide). This PR corrects both instructions (such as `git rebase jwasham/master`) and links that still reference the old branch name. I left links which reference `master` in other repositories (either forks of this repo, or your personal `practice-*` repos) that aren't yet updated to use `main`.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, please let me know if I did everything alright! Thanks.",
