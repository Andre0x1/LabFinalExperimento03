When we click on AppDynamic it takes us to the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://roadmap.sh/devops/monitoring/application-monitoring/app-dynamics\r\n\r\nBut the correct URL is as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://roadmap.sh/devops/application-monitoring/app-dynamics\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed in the JSON file, but we are not updating the JSON files due to implementing the Roadmap editor. One more thing that is not implemented correctly is when fetching topic detail, If we get an error we are setting the error to Topic not found but we are not hiding the loader and there is not content to be shown if some error occurs. Also, we are not resetting the error to empty due to which after an error occurs no new topic can be opened and it stays in the loading state.\r\n\r\nI have tried an implementation for exception management that will notify the user of the issue and the user will be able to view other topics even when some topic has an issue.\r\n\r\nAttached is a simple error message page.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/assets/43681543/aac453a4-a57f-4e58-a688-b55ba13c5c28)\r\n",
