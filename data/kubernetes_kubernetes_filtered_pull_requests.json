It caused a stale entry to remain in the root path and could potentially lead to memory leak as the groupDiscoveryHandler was never released and the handledGroups was never cleaned up.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# curl 127.0.0.1:8001\r\n{\r\n  \"paths\": [\r\n    \"/.well-known/openid-configuration\",\r\n    \"/api\",\r\n    ...\r\n    \"/apis/wardle.example.com\",         <- group that has been deleted\r\n    ...\r\n    \"/readyz/shutdown\",\r\n    \"/version\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe commit implements the cleanup. It tracks each group's usage and unregister the a group when there is no version for this group.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it fixes a test step in TestSampleAPIServer that it validated APIService deletion using unmatched selector, which selected nothing when deleting and listing APIServices.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

Due to `PodDisruptionConditions` feature-gate getting enabled by default in 1.26\r\nIf a pod is created with the same keys in its spec, ex:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n  - image: registry.k8s.io/hpa-example\r\n    imagePullPolicy: Always\r\n    name: php-apache\r\n    env:\r\n      - name: hi\r\n        value: hi\r\n      - name: hi\r\n        value: hi\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe user will receive a warning `Warning: spec.containers[0].env[1].name: duplicate name \"hi\"` but the pod will still be created. However, when the pod becomes a candidate for garbage collection, it won't be deleted as it will continuously fail to apply the status with error `failed to create manager for existing fields: failed to convert new object (default/php-apache; /v1, Kind=Pod) to smd typed: .spec.containers[name=\"php-apache\"].env: duplicate entries for key [name=\"hi\"]` \r\nThis will cause the ghost pod(s) to remain there indefinitely. This can be a problem for deployments with the old pods not getting clean up new ones won't spin up. \r\n```\r\ndev-dsk-luukasz-2b-3776d48b % kubectl get pods,nodes -A\r\nNAMESPACE     NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\r\ndefault       pod/php-apache                 1/1     Running   0          3m12s\r\nkube-system   pod/coredns-6ff9c46cd8-6v7d8   0/1     Pending   0          40s\r\n```\r\nThis is the \"simple\" fix for covering this bug, alternatively we could change the validation of the pod, but that seems like a much bigger lift. \r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\nTested in 1.28 / 1.27, but most likely in 1.26 as well. Can be re-produced by spinning up a pod with the env mentioned above and then deleting the hosting worker node.\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n\r\n",

So let's fix the existing code...\r\n\r\nThis is not _just_ porting existing `pointer` code to use `ptr`, it also gets rid of a lot of temporary variables we had been creating so we could then take pointers to them, in most cases because we needed pointers of specific types (like `*v1.Protocol`) which the pre-generics `pointer` package didn't do. But now we can do that, so let's do that, to make things more consistent.\r\n\r\nI did this as multiple commits for ease of review but they're intended to be squashed (and in particular, the first commit mostly exists just to provide the overall commit message and is not intended to be internally-consistent).\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\nSee https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/pull/283\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n",

However, the command lines related to containerd were retained. Therefore, it is worth considering replacing `docker_env_metadata_whitelist` with `containerd_env_metadata_whitelist` instead of removing it directly. This approach ensures compatibility after runtime switching and maintains management stability.\r\n\r\nAlthough cadvisor provides the `env_metadata_whitelist` command line, it currently supports only two runtimes. Directly replacing it might introduce more vendor code, increasing complexity. Hence, opting to replace it with `containerd_env_metadata_whitelist` is a more cautious and prudent choice.\r\n\r\nThis method maintains stability at the code level without introducing excessive external dependencies, ensuring system reliability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

They can use http2, but with the performance of http1\r\n(with keep-alive disabled).\r\n\r\nSince this change has the potential to cause issues, the\r\nUnauthenticatedHTTP2DOSMitigation feature gate can be disabled to\r\nremove this protection (it is enabled by default).  For example,\r\nwhen the API server is fronted by an L7 load balancer that is set up\r\nto mitigate http2 attacks, unauthenticated clients could force\r\ndisable connection reuse between the load balancer and the API\r\nserver (many incoming connections could share the same backend\r\nconnection).  An API server that is on a private network may opt to\r\ndisable this protection to prevent performance regressions for\r\nunauthenticated clients.\r\n\r\nFor all other clients, we rely on the golang.org/x/net fix in\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/net/commit/b225e7ca6dde1ef5a5ae5ce922861bda011cfabd\r\nThat change is not sufficient to adequately protect against a\r\nmotivated client - future changes to Kube and/or golang.org/x/net\r\nwill be explored to address this gap.\r\n\r\nThe Kube API server now uses a max stream of 100 instead of 250\r\n(this matches the Go http2 client default).  This lowers the abuse\r\nlimit from 1000 to 400.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Monis Khan <mok@microsoft.com>\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\nMitigates http/2 DOS vulnerabilities for CVE-2023-44487 and CVE-2023-39325 for the API server when the client is unauthenticated. The mitigation may be disabled by setting the `UnauthenticatedHTTP2DOSMitigation` feature gate to `false` (it is enabled by default). An API server fronted by an L7 load balancer that already mitigates these http/2 attacks may choose to disable the kube-apiserver mitigation to avoid disrupting load balancer \u2192 kube-apiserver connections if http/2 requests from multiple clients share the same backend connection. An API server on a private network may opt to disable the kube-apiserver mitigation to prevent performance regressions for unauthenticated clients.

The fix here is therefore that we re-introduce the readiness predicate for eTP:Local services so that the predicates align across all classes of services. We can't do the inverse and remove the readiness predicate for eTP:Cluster, because that's the KEP-3458.  \r\n\r\n/sig network\r\n/sig cloud-provider\r\n/assign @thockin \r\n/cc @aojea \r\n\r\nThis PR should have no effect on >= 1.27 since the predicates are already aligned under the feature gate `StableLoadBalancerNodeSet`, but this should get in so that we guard against the broken behaviour should someone turn that feature gate off. \r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes #121094\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

(This still requires a small amount of backoff-and-retry, but gets us down to ~5s.)\r\n\r\n`Test_detectNodeIPs` previously had a `\"No Valid IP found and unspecified bind address\"` test case that had been commented out in the past because it hit the slow path even before #119525; I uncommented that out, but also had to update the expected result for the changes in #119525.\r\n\r\n`Test_detectNodeIPs` was also previously testing node InternalIPs vs ExternalIPs, but that's irrelevant to `detectNodeIPs`/`getNodeIPs`'s purposes; `utilnode.GetNodeHostIPs` deals with making sure that part of node-IP-getting works correctly, and has its own unit tests for that, so we don't need to separately test that here (and the tests were doing a bad job of testing it anyway).\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nNone, I just noticed the problem while working on something else.\r\nAlso, this was introduced post-1.28, so nothing needs to be backported.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @uablrek ",

Make a dummy nftables backend. (The first commit, \"`Add a dummy nftables kube-proxy backend which is just a copy of iptables`\".) This also includes the feature gate.\r\n2. Simplify the \"nftables\" backend by removing tricky optimizations, iptables-specific hacks, and features we aren't implementing in nftables. (From \"`Simplify nftables/proxier.go by removing large-cluster mode`\" to \"`Drop unit tests of iptables-specific unit test helpers`\").\r\n3. Port the remaining iptables logic over to nftables in a straightforward way. (From \"`Create an nftables.Interface in nftables proxier`\" to \"`Port NAT rules to nftables (and backend is now functional)`\")\r\n4. Start improving things by using new nftables functionality. (From \"`Redo --nodeport-addresses handling with a set`\" to \"`Redo service dispatch with maps`\")\r\n\r\n(We can potentially squash some or all of parts 1-3 if we don't think it's useful to keep that history.)\r\n\r\nTo do before merging:\r\n- [x] Make it actually work. (An earlier version did, so the general shape is correct, and high-level-reviewable.)\r\n\r\nTo do before alpha but not necessarily in *this* PR:\r\n- [ ] Re-add partial syncing\r\n- [ ] Fix up metrics\r\n- [ ] Adjust default `--nodeport-addresses` behavior\r\n- [ ] Figure out the required kernel/userspace versions, possibly add fallback/workarounds if the requirements of the current code are too recent.\r\n- [ ] Clean up iptables rules when starting nftables and nftables rules when starting iptables/ipvs (if feature gate is enabled)\r\n- [ ] Improved startup error checking relative to iptables\r\n- [ ] Re-add unit tests for unit test helpers (eg `assertNFTablesTransactionEqual`) and otherwise ensure iptables-unit-test-parity\r\n- [ ] create an e2e job\r\n\r\nTo do but not necessarily before alpha:\r\n- [ ] perf job\r\n- [ ] Revisit memory allocation perf fixes (eg reusing buffers)\r\n- [ ] Test out `set`-based rather than `mark`-based mark-for-masquerade\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nkube-proxy now has a new nftables-based mode, available by running\r\nkube-proxy --feature-gates NFTablesProxyMode=true --proxy-mode nftables\r\n\r\nThis is currently an alpha-level feature and while it probably will not eat\r\nyour data, it may nibble at it a bit.\r\n\r\nFIXME add notes about feature differences, once the set of feature differences stabilizes\r\nFIXME add notes about performance claims, once we have performance claims\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n```docs\r\n- [KEP]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3866\r\n```\r\n",

The library is mirrored off of the one in `kube-openapi` for unstructured and CRD's. It merges the functionality of the separate kube-openapi validator, listsetmaps, ratcheting.\r\n\r\nKEP explains why a new library is used over modifying the existing ones:\r\n- Existing validation libraries require structural.Schema, which our native types do not conform to.\r\n- kube-openapi library is based off unstructured, we want to use `value.Value` to avoid unstructured conversion. \r\n- More control over error messages\r\n\r\nSo far the library has been tested to have near perfect parity with the existing suite when used against CRDs with `kubectl-validates` test cases.

We've had intermittent issues when changes to `runc` as an application bites us as we use `runc` as a library.\r\n\r\nSo We need an accurate inventory of where/how we use `runc` (directly and indirectly via `cadvisor`) so we can figure out with `runc` folks on eventually ending up with a well maintained library instead of the situation today.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we have 2 `.import-restrictions` files that have the list of packages we use. There is more we can do in the `cm` package but the changes are not worth the trouble as it will be onerous to review. This PR is mostly mechanical changes, we have defined public methods in `libcontainer` and we replace existing usages with that essentially.\r\n\r\n<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!

This assumption doesn't hold for plugins which need to observe and potentially modified other cluster state, like the dynamic resource allocation plugin.\r\n\r\nSuch plugins need a way to do its own snapshotting of the cluster state at the start of a simulation and then update that snapshotting while the cluster autoscaler simulates the placement of pods on nodes.\r\n\r\nThe new ClusterAutoScalerPlugin interface provides a mechanism for this. It is not used anywhere in kube-scheduler itself, but has to be defined here because plugins cannot get it from k8s.io/autoscaler (circular dependency) and creating a new repo seems overkill.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nRelated-to: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118612\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThis needs to be reviewed in combination with the corresponding change in cluster autoscaler.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n\r\n```docs\r\n- [KEP]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @mwielgus @alculquicondor @MaciekPytel ",

The main reason for not extending it to the API server and kubectl was that checkpointing is a completely new concept.\r\n\r\nAlthough the result of the checkpointing, the checkpoint archive, is only accessible by root it is important to remember that it contains all memory pages and thus all possible passwords, private keys and random numbers. With the checkpoint archive being only accessible by root it does not directly make it easier to access this potentially confidential information as root would be able to retrieve that information anyway.\r\n\r\nNow, at least three Kubernetes releases later, we have not heard any negative feedback about the checkpoint archive and its data. There were, however, many questions to be able to create a checkpoint via kubectl and not just via the kubelet API endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds 'checkpoint' support to kubectl. The 'checkpoint' command is heavily influenced by the code of the 'exec' and 'logs' command. The checkpoint command is only available behind the 'alpha' sub-command as the \"Forensic Container Checkpointing\" KEP is still marked as Alpha.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\n $ kubectl alpha checkpoint test-pod-1 -c container-2\r\n Node:                  127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1\r\n Namespace:             default\r\n Pod:                   test-pod-1\r\n Container:             container-2\r\n Checkpoint Archive:    /var/lib/kubelet/checkpoints/checkpoint-archive.tar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tests are implemented that they handle a CRI implementation with and without a implementation of the CRI RPC call 'ContainerCheckpoint'.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nAdded `checkpoint` command to kubectl.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n```docs\r\n- [KEP]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2008\r\n```\r\n",

As part of that change, the helper library for DRA drivers was updated to match that behavior. Since then, driver deployments were either compatible with Kubernetes 1.27 when using k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation 0.27 or Kubernetes 1.28 when using  0.28, but never both.\r\n\r\nThis was okay because this is an alpha feature, but it makes testing of DRA drivers harder (in particular because cloud providers have not all updated to 1.28 yet) and can be fixed fairly easily. Therefore adding back support for 1.27 is worthwhile and reasonable.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nk8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation: DRA drivers updating to this release are compatible with Kubernetes 1.27 and 1.28.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n\r\n```docs\r\n- [KEP]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @elezar ",

In https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/20647 this was moved to the kubenet plugin instead (since it is not needed and not wanted for some other network plugins), and kube-proxy was changed to just warn if br-netfilter was not loaded / bridge-nf-call-iptables was not set, with the comment \"Until most plugins handle this, log when config is missing\". That was seven and a half years ago. Presumably everyone got the message by now.\r\n\r\n(Note also that the check and the warning are both IPv4-specific; to make kube-proxy work correctly with linux-bridge-based plugins under IPv6, you need to set bridge-nf-call-ip6tables instead. e.g., this was fixed in kubeadm in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53013, but no one ever suggested that maybe kube-proxy should warn people about that...)\r\n\r\nWhich issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nFixes #120849 \r\n\r\n Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\r\n```NONE```\r\n",

OTOH, with [an appropriate nftables version of `iptablesTracer`](https://github.com/danwinship/kubernetes/blob/fdc32374f4b79e1543f7baba2b746ab5f5b091fd/pkg/proxy/nftables/helpers_test.go#L126), we can just [copy the `runPacketFlowTests` tests over verbatim](https://github.com/danwinship/kubernetes/blob/fdc32374f4b79e1543f7baba2b746ab5f5b091fd/pkg/proxy/nftables/proxier_test.go#L627), and show that they work with no changes. (Or in some cases, that certain changes are required to the expected outputs due to intentional behavioral changes like the lack of `-j ACCEPT` rules.)\r\n\r\n(I would like to eventually move the packet flow tests out of `pkg/proxy/iptables` entirely, and have the same test cases shared by iptables and nftables, and hopefully eventually winkernel too, and ipvs if someone else wants to implement that.)\r\n\r\nSo anyway, this PR gets rid of most of the `assertIPTablesRuleEqual` tests, in some cases adding new `runPacketFlowTests` tests to cover cases that were previously not covered. In the process I tried to clean up and combine some of the existing tests, which had weird combinations of redundancy and testing gaps... merging related tests together makes it easier to see what we are and aren't covering.\r\n\r\nA bit of history: \r\n- Up until 2019 / k8s 1.16, we didn't have any tests that actually looked at the full iptables dump. Instead they each just did a bunch of checks like \"make sure there's a rule somewhere in `KUBE-SERVICES` with `-d 10.20.30.41` and `--dport 80` that calls `-j REJECT`\".\r\n- The addition of EndpointSlice support in #81430 was the first time we added a unit test that actually looked at `fp.iptablesData.String()` in full, and we followed up with similar tests in the next few features we added, although these tests were limited by the fact that they could each only use a single service with a single endpoint, because otherwise the output was non-deterministic. \r\n- #106030 improved our ability to compare iptables rule dumps enough that we could use them for every test, which seemed preferable to the weird `hasJump`, etc, checks we had before, so I just changed all of the tests to use iptables rule dumps (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/9403bfb17893462abb90b02206296688c0e3de3b).\r\n- A few months later I added the packet flow tests in #107471, but people felt like it was good to have the redundancy of both kinds of test. (And maybe, initially, people were a little dubious of the packet flow tests.)\r\n\r\nSo while there's some sense that \"oh but we've always done it this way so we shouldn't get rid of those tests now\", that's not really accurate. We've always tested the rule output using the best technology that was available to our unit tests, and right now, that's the flow tests, not the strcmp tests.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n",

It means that even if the lease has expired, candidates that observe it for the first time won't try to acquire it.\r\nIt could be observed with a simple new test case under `testTryAcquireOrRenew` which doesn't pass on the current master branch:\r\n```\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tname: \"first acquisition of expired object\",\r\n\t\t\treactors: []Reactor{\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tverb: \"get\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\treaction: func(action fakeclient.Action) (handled bool, ret runtime.Object, err error) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn true, createLockObject(t, objectType, action.GetNamespace(), action.(fakeclient.GetAction).GetName(), &rl.LeaderElectionRecord{HolderIdentity: \"bing\", AcquireTime: metav1.NewTime(past), RenewTime: metav1.NewTime(past)}), nil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tverb: \"update\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\treaction: func(action fakeclient.Action) (handled bool, ret runtime.Object, err error) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn true, action.(fakeclient.CreateAction).GetObject(), nil\r\n\t\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\texpectSuccess:    true,\r\n\t\t\ttransitionLeader: true,\r\n\t\t\toutHolder:        \"baz\",\r\n\t\t},\r\n```\r\nThis behavior is desirable in a scenario where the different nodes of a same cluster might be out of sync. However, for many use cases, we can assume that the clock skew is bounded.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

In #20647 this was moved to the kubenet plugin instead (since it is not needed and not wanted for some other network plugins), and kube-proxy was changed to just warn if `br-netfilter` was not loaded / `bridge-nf-call-iptables` was not set, with the comment \"Until most plugins handle this, log when config is missing\". That was seven and a half years ago. Presumably everyone got the message by now.\r\n\r\n(Note also that the check and the warning are both IPv4-specific; to make kube-proxy work correctly with linux-bridge-based plugins under IPv6, you need to set `bridge-nf-call-ip6tables` instead. e.g., this was fixed in kubeadm in #53013, but no one ever suggested that maybe kube-proxy should warn people about that...)\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @dcbw \r\n",

The apiservice spec update should be done async by the controller.\r\n\r\nFix is to not update the spec in the addupdateapiservice flow during startup. This is handled async by the openapi controller.\r\n\r\nI've discovered https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/120878 while working on the above two issues: The code path when an apiservice exists and needs to be updated was not handled properly. I've refactored the CacheableDownloader to have an new function `UpdateHandler()` and call that in `AddUpdateAPIService()` if the apiservice already exists. I've also removed the `decorateError` function and integrated the better logging directly in the downloader.\r\n\r\nI've fixed the `AddUpdateAPIService` flow and added integration tests to simulate the cases described in #120758 and #120739. Added additional unit tests to catch #120878. Tried to keep the changes self contained since we need to backport.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/120758\r\nFixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/120739\r\nFixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/120878\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.
