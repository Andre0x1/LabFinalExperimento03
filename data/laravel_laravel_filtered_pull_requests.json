Sometimes I need 10 columns, or 9 columns, or 8 columns, or 11 columns, etc I need to use Model::query()->select(...columns) to expect unnecessary columns and this is so time-consuming and painful for a developer which I felt. That's why I need a new scopeMethod in this branch in Article Model. In this Article model, there are scopeExceptColumns which receive 2 params. The First is Eloquent Build and the second is an array that contains columns of the current model and it works as the Other Builder method works. I think this will be helpful for other Laravel developers",

The current default of 10 was set in PHP 11 years ago, which is no longer a suitable default.\r\n\r\n12 appears to be the sweet spot between performance and security, [as confirmed by a member of the Hashcat team](https://phpc.social/@tychotithonus@infosec.exchange/111104389164750098). [Symfony uses a cost of 13](https://github.com/symfony/password-hasher/blob/6.3/Hasher/NativePasswordHasher.php#L36C1-L37C1), however that may be too high for some servers.\r\n\r\nDue to the way hashing works, there are no backwards compatibility issues - older passwords with lower rounds will still be handled properly, and code that automatically rehashes passwords will upgrade them over time. It's also worth pointing out that since rounds are defined in `config/hashing.php`, existing projects won't automatically get the new rounds cost and thus won't have any performance impacts. [The RFC contains hash calculation timings](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023) if you'd like more information on the impacts.\r\n\r\nIncreasing rounds to 12 in `config/hashing.php` should be a recommended upgrade step for Laravel 11 (and possibly added to the guide for 10?).\r\n\r\nFramework PR: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/48494",

        "body": "Hello maintainers,\r\n\r\nI hope you're doing well. I've made a minor but valuable change to the project. With the **recent addition of NativePHP** in the Laravel ecosystem, **which compiles the build into the dist folder**, it's now generating a substantial number of files. I believe it would be beneficial to ignore these files in the .gitignore, to prevent new developers from accidentally committing them.\r\n\r\n**Currently, the dist folder is not being ignored in the .gitignore file, which causes the git logs to display a multitude of changed files. This situation can be a bit overwhelming for contributors and users alike.**\r\n\r\nTo address this, I've included the necessary entry in the .gitignore file to ignore the dist folder and its contents. By doing so, we can keep the repository cleaner and avoid any unintentional commits of build artifacts.\r\n\r\nI've thoroughly tested this modification on my forked copy, and everything is working seamlessly. While it's a small adjustment, I believe it will greatly enhance the development experience for all contributors and newcomers.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my contribution. I'm excited about the opportunity to improve this amazing open-source Laravel project, and I look forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAkash Singh",

Configuration that was previously done in this file can be done in the `bootstrap/app.php` file, including registering / replacing middleware.\r\n\r\nThe console kernel has been removed. Schedules can be defined in the console \u201croutes\u201d file. Commands generated by `make:command` are automatically loaded and do not require registration. Additional command loading paths can be registered in the `bootstrap/app.php` file.\r\n\r\nThe exception handler has been removed. Exception handling behavior can be configured in the `bootstrap/app.php` file.\r\n\r\nThe base HTTP controller no longer extends any other classes (requiring new middleware definition feature). No traits are included by default on the base controller.\r\n\r\nAll middleware has been removed. Configuration of these middleware\u2019s behavior can be done via static methods on the middleware themselves (see framework notes).\r\n\r\nThe `User` model now utilizes a `casts` method instead of a property. The `HasApiTokens` trait has been removed by default since Sanctum is not installed by default.\r\n\r\nAll service providers except the `AppServiceProvider` have been removed. Policies are auto-discovered and gates can be registered in `AppServiceProvider`. Likewise, events can be registered in `AppServiceProvider`. Routing behavior is now determined / customized in the `bootstrap/app.php` file.\r\n\r\nNew `bootstrap/app.php` file can be used to customize core framework behavior like routing, container bindings, middleware, and exception handling.\r\n\r\nSanctum is no longer installed by default (see `install:api`).\r\n\r\nConfiguration files are not present by default. Can be published by `config:publish` command. Default values are present in the framework and application level configuration now cascades with framework definitions, so only customized values need be present in application level configuration files.\r\n\r\nMigration files have been re-dated to be evergreen. The `password_reset_tokens` table migration has been combined into the `users` table migration file. Likewise, the `jobs` table migration has been combined into a single migration with the `failed_jobs` table.\r\n\r\nEcho bootstrapping has been removed by default. It is re-inserted by new `install:broadcasting` command.\r\n\r\nAPI and channel routes files are not present by default, can be recreated by `install:api` and `install:broadcasting` respectively.",

        "body": "**This PR does NOT affect existing applications. Only new applications.**\r\n\r\nCompanion to and requires: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/47040\r\n\r\n**Intro:** Over the years, Laravel has accumulated quite a bit of \"noise\" in its application skeleton. Middleware stubs that aren't really required. Noisy bootstrapping files. Manual event and policy registration properties when neither are technically required anymore thanks to auto discovery. Stale migration timestamps. Too many migrations in general. This PR attempts to take the skeleton back down to a slimmer foundation with a more essential set of files, providing a generally more \"light-weight\" vibe to the skeleton application.\r\n\r\n- Policies property removed from `AuthServiceProvider`. Policy auto-discovery has existed for a long time. The `$policies` property can be added back manually if desired.\r\n- The `SendEmailVerificationNotification` is now registered automatically by the base `EventServiceProvider`. It longer needs to be in the application skeleton taking up space.\r\n- Event discovery enabled by default. This is just a better developer experience.\r\n- Broadcast routes file now loaded automatically thanks to call to `withBroadcasting` in bootstrap file. BroadcastServiceProvider no longer necessary.\r\n- Guest middleware now has base definition so it just a simple `redirectTo` method.\r\n- Authenticated middleware no longer calls `redirectTo` for JSON routes at all by default. Removes an unnecessary ternary check in the application skeleton middleware.\r\n- `TrustProxies` removed from skeleton. Core version trusts all proxies by default as this is common in a modern AWS / Cloud world. Can override it if you need to.\r\n- `TrustHosts` removed from skeleton. Core version has sensible defaults. Kernel updated to use core version.\r\n- `ValidateSignature` removed from skeleton. Base version registered as middleware alias. New static `except` method can be used to add ignored parameters if you wish via your `AppServiceProvider`.\r\n- HTTP component version of `ValidatePostSize` now used by kernel.\r\n- CSRF middleware now references `ValidateCsrfToken` for naming consistency.\r\n- Sanctum configuration file updated to use `validate_csrf_token`.\r\n- Base `EncryptCookies` and `TrimStrings` middleware are now used by default. No longer needed in skeleton. Static `except` methods added to both middleware for runtime configuration in `AppServiceProvider` if needed.\r\n- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands` are now discovered by default. No need to call `load` in console kernel.\r\n- \"Console\" routes file is removed. Closure based Artisan commands can now be registered directly in the console kernel.\r\n- Removed `PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance` \u2026 use framework version directly. Secrets / tokens are more robust way to access entire site during maintenance mode.\r\n- Consolidated migrations into a single default migration. Sanctum migration already runs automatically because it exists in Sanctum package. Migration renamed to begin with `0001_...` so it is evergreen and doesn't appear \"old\".\r\n- ~~New `file` failed job storage driver is default. Removed need to have a `failed_jobs` table migration in the skeleton by default.~~\r\n- Database queued jobs table and failed jobs table are now consolidated into a single migration\r\n- `ValidateCsrfToken` removed from skeleton by default. Static `except` method added to core middleware for excluding certain URIs from CSRF verification.\r\n- Removed two traits from base controller. Validation using `$this->validate` in controllers has not been documented in some time. `$this->authorize` can simply be `Gate::authorize`.\r\n- `bootstrap/app.php` file has been greatly simplified.\r\n- Exception handler is no longer in the skeleton. All exception handling configuration can be done in application bootstrap file by calling the handler's public methods to ignore certain exceptions or customize their rendering. Or, you can use renderable and reportable exceptions.\r\n\r\n**Remaining tasks:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation updates to reflect all changes\r\n- [ ] Breeze ships an `AuthServiceProvider` stub which needs to be updated to match changes here\r\n- [ ] Jetstream publishes a new user table migration which needs to be updated to match changes here, including file name change\r\n- [ ] Fortify publishes a migration with a 2014 timestamp. It could optionally be updated to a newer timestamp but no changes are technically required",

This will enable more accurate performance tracking and debugging of slow requests.\r\n\r\n**Files modified:**\r\n- artisan\r\n- public/index.php\r\n\r\n**Further notes:**\r\nLARAVEL_HR_START stands for LARAVEL_HIGH_RESOLUTION_START. The question of whether to abbreviate or not begins with PHP's own function using the abbreviated form. I think it makes sense to abbreviate because PHP abbreviates.\r\n\r\nWe cannot replace the functionality of microtime(true) with hrtime(true), but we can include both approaches by default. hrtime(true) will greatly improve the accuracy of performance tracking, which I've found necessary in web crawling and scraping applications where optimizations are important to improve your application's capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn respect of existing applications usage of LARAVEL_START, my pull request runs LARAVEL_HR_START first to ensure LARAVEL_START is unaltered, which also makes sense since LARAVEL_HR_START can then track the full execution time of the application including the definition of LARAVEL_START. This is of course a very minor concern.",

        "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nIf there is no `ASSET_URL` for a Laravel project, Laravel will fallback to appending the current request's host. It ignores the `APP_URL`.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nAPP_URL=https://app-url.com\r\nASSET_URL=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the site is served at `http://127.0.0.1:8008`...\r\n\r\n```php\r\nasset('style.css');\r\n\r\n// http://127.0.0.1:8000/style.css \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works great for the backend, but Vite will never know what the host of the request is, as all its knowledge must be known at build time. So Vite and Laravel can not truly share the asset URL across the build time / runtime divide _when `ASSET_URL` is empty_.\r\n\r\n**Why is this a problem?**\r\n\r\nLaravel outputs preload tags for all the required assets for the initial page load (hashes removed for readability).\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally we use the `asset` helper to generate these URLs. You can see they have appended the incoming request host.\r\n\r\nWhen Vite boots and on subsequent page navigation Vite will also preload all required assets that _have not yet been seen_.\r\n\r\nVite does not know about `http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/app.css`. Vite only knows about `/build/assets/app.css`. This results in duplicate preload tags populating the document on initial page load.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't hugely problematic, as the browser knows that both of these URLs point to the same resource, i.e. the browser doesn't try to preload 2 sets of resources. The Vite preloads are a noop in the case that Laravel has already output its own preload tags.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIf we have the `ASSET_URL` fallback to a `/` (which was not possible in `9.x` but is in `10.x`) we get uniform output from both Laravel and Vite, and thus Vite does not output duplicate tags.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could look at changing this in the framework, but I figure doing it in the skeleton allows for ultimate control for developers if they want to restore the previous functionality of using the incoming request's host.\r\n\r\n## Not just a Vite problem\r\n\r\nAlthough this is motivated by a Vite related problem, this will benefit other and future tools. \r\n\r\nI believe that a known static value for `ASSET_URL` makes total sense as a default. The asset helper is meant to link to assets, and very often those assets are built by a 3rd party. This allows a more expected shared value across the runtime / build time divide.\r\n\r\nI also don't believe this should be problematic in anyway, because the request host and `/` should be equivalent unless you are doing something really funky.",

This includes:  **Laravel `v10.x`** skeleton, generated code by `make` commands, starter kits like breeze and jetstream, and more. Let's see some examples:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n          *\r\n          * Run the migrations.\r\n-         *\r\n-         * @return void\r\n          */\r\n-        public function up()\r\n+        public function up(): void\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n         /**\r\n          * Handle the User \"created\" event.\r\n-         *\r\n-         * @param  \\App\\Models\\User  $user\r\n-         * @return void\r\n         */\r\n-        public function created($user)\r\n+        public function created(User $user): void\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Define the application's command schedule.\r\n     *\r\n-    * @param  \\Illuminate\\Console\\Scheduling\\Schedule  $schedule\r\n-    * @return void\r\n     */\r\n-    protected function schedule($schedule)\r\n+    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, PHP native types were added in a way that is **realistically possible** \u2014  and **without breaking changes**. In addition, we are equally proposing changes coding-style-wise. Let's see the proposed changes in detail:\r\n\r\n1. **Allow user-land types around methods arguments and return types**. Due to PHP's covariance and contravariance rules, we've typed **only arguments** on classes that exist user vendor directory, so all the cases below are possible:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass A { function foo(string $a); } // framework\r\nclass B extends A { function foo($a); } // skeleton\r\nclass C extends A { function foo($a): int; } // skeleton\r\nclass D extends A { function foo(string $a); } // skeleton\r\nclass E extends A { function foo(string $a): int ; } // skeleton\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing this reasoning, none of the changes made at framework level are breaking, and users can remove type-hints if they want.\r\n\r\n2. **Removal of superfluous PHP annotations**. So, when the native argument type or return type is exactly the same as the PHP Annotation, we can safely remove it. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Update the specified resource in storage.\r\n-    *\r\n-    * @param  \\Illuminate\\Http\\Request  $request\r\n-    * @param  \\App\\Models\\Chirp  $chirp\r\n-    * @return \\Illuminate\\Http\\Response\r\n     */\r\n-    public function update(Request $request, Chirp $chirp)\r\n+    public function update(Request $request, Chirp $chirp): Response\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet, if the PHP annotation adds auto-completion or static analysis value, we keep it, so the user can leverage a better developer experience. In the example below, we know via the native type that the return should be an array, and via the PHP annotation that should be an array composed of string values:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get the host patterns that should be trusted.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return array<int, string>\r\n     */\r\n-    public function hosts()\r\n+    public function hosts(): array\r\n    {\r\n        return [\r\n            'laravel.test',\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. **Allow user-land types around closures arguments**. This pull request proposes adding native typing around closures arguments, but not return types to keep the code aesthetically pretty:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    public function register(): void\r\n    {\r\n-        $this->reportable(function ($e) {\r\n+        $this->reportable(function (Throwable $e) {\r\n            //\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen convenient for the code - meaning that It's obvious that the user will always return the first line - the closures may be replaced by short closures. And here, the rules are the same, where native PHP typing only gets applied to arguments:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Indicate that the model's email address should be unverified.\r\n     */\r\n    public function unverified(): static\r\n    {\r\n-        return $this->state(function (array $attributes) {\r\n-            return [\r\n-                'email_verified_at' => null,\r\n-            ];\r\n-        });\r\n\r\n+        return $this->state(fn (array $attributes) => [\r\n+            'email_verified_at' => null,\r\n+        ]);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. **We are not addressing typed properties**.  While this pull request makes pretty much possible to use native typing on an entire Laravel project, our users won't be able type \"properties\" that are extended from Framework classes. E.g: Models, service providers, etc. This does not mean we are not addressing in the future, yet it does not belong to the scope of this pull request.\r\n\r\nThe rules stated above should be applied across the entire Laravel organization. And bellow, we talk about how we are doing that.",

The goal of this is to make it even more frictionless for people to get started with implementing precognition requests.\r\n\r\nPrecognition requests are invoked with a `Precognition: true` header meaning apps that don't explicitly pass this aren't affected. The only thing that's left to do for users is to implement the `isPrecognitive` checks in their apps. Adding the middleware on a route-per-route basis isn't needed anymore. \r\n\r\nPeople can still turn off this global middleware and implement on a route-per-route basis but I could not see a problem by adding this by default.",

in my `.env` file, copied straight from the `.env.example`.\r\n\r\nI've had a quick look and it seems that this field is being treated at `null` rather than `\"null\"` so it's not using the `\"null\"` logging channel (which I'm guessing is the intended channel).\r\n\r\nThe following changes seem to stop the `Unable to create configured logger.` error from being logged:\r\n\r\n- Removing the `LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL`field completely from the `.env` so that it falls back to the value set in the `config/logging.php` file.\r\n- Or, using a different channel for the `LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL`.\r\n- Or, as a weird experiment, I changed the name of the `\"null\"` channel to `\"nulll\"` in the `.env` (to stop any possible casting from `\"null\"` to `null`) and the `config/logging.php` and it seems to stop the issue.\r\n\r\nSo based on this, I wondered if it was worth removing the `LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL` field from the `.env.example` so that other people don't trip up over it the same as I did?\r\n\r\nAs I said though, if this is just something on my end that I've not done quite right, I apologise! \ud83d\ude04",

We\u2019ve received a lot of feedback that various features of the Ably Laravel integration don\u2019t work as expected, often caused by the fact that there\u2019s a dependency on the Pusher JavaScript SDK which we have no control over. This collection of PRs adds a new broadcaster which uses the ably-js SDK which means that we can ensure that the Ably broadcaster will remain stable. We are more than happy to take feedback and answer any questions about the work presented here :)\r\n\r\nAdds example environment variables to .env.example for the new AblyBroadcaster and references them in broadcasting.php.\r\n",

Such as the [UTM tracking parameters](https://usefathom.com/utm-builder) (`utm_*`), and Facebook's `fbclid` parameter,  which it adds to any links clicked for tracking purposes.\r\n\r\nSince these are added as query parameters, they break the signature and prevent the URL from being validated.\r\n\r\n### Solution \r\n\r\nMy solution is to replicate the design used in other core middleware (i.e. `EncryptCookies`, `PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance`, `TrimStrings`, & `VerifyCsrfToken`) and include a configurable `$ignore` parameter, which can be used to specify the query parameters to be ignored when verifying the signature.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ValidateSignature extends Middleware\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * The names of the parameters that should be ignored.\r\n     *\r\n     * @var array<int, string>\r\n     */\r\n    protected $ignore = [\r\n        'utm_campaign',\r\n        'utm_source',\r\n        'utm_medium',\r\n        'utm_content',\r\n        'utm_term',\r\n        'fbclid',\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions...\r\n\r\nThe big question is if common tracking query parameters should be ignored by default. \r\n\r\nSigned URL issues are hard to debug, such as when they are [shared on Facebook](https://twitter.com/warsh33p/status/1547113243616870401), so having these default ignored would be beneficial in most cases. However it would break signed URLs that legitimately include those parameters. Although the argument could be made that you'd need to update the middleware to introduce these parameters, so it shouldn't break existing signed URLs.\r\n\r\nI've defaulted them commented out for now to be safe, but enabled by default should be considered.",

So not the [laravel/framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework) version, as this was already explained in the other answer, but the Laravel \"starter app\" [laravel/laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) version?\r\n\r\n>  (I am interested in this so I could compare the differences on GitHub, but I don't know which tag/branch was used when the original app was created over a year ago.)\r\n\r\nI found myself in a similar situation while ago. AFAIK there is no way to find out the version of the Laravel skeleton (`laravel/laravel`not `laravel/framework`) which an app was bootstrapped from. \r\n\r\nAs I can see in https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/4186 it was an active decision in 2017 to leave CHANGELOG.md out of the releases. But I would argue that it would be helpful to include CHANGELOG.md as README.md is included. \r\n\r\nMaybe the decision of that time can be reconsidered?\r\n\r\nBy including CHANGELOG.md developers will be able to compare their skeleton version with the current version, and easily find the relevant changes since the app got created. \r\n\r\nDevelopers who don't want to keep the file can delete it as they can delete the readme.",
