The build already had this dependency before my breaking PR - i.e. `logger.vcxproj` _was_ reading the output of `Version.vcxproj` - my PR correctly stated the dependency as a `ProjectReference`.  My PR also added `ProjectConfiguration` to `Version.vcxproj` to fix the \"build within a build\" that was happening.  Some interplay of \"project not being in the solution\" caused things to go ... weird.  This was helpful to me FWIW https://www.aligrant.com/web/blog/2020-02-28_msbuild_reverting_to_debug_for_dependencies\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Specifically, I have 2 physical mic devices and NVIDIA Broadcast device, and NVIDIA device wasn't unmuting in 90% cases after initial mute.\r\n\r\nAfter debugging, it turns out that the callbacks for `VolumeNotifier::OnNotify` are in a race with `setMuteChangedCallback` to make the NVIDIA device muted, since `getMicrophoneMuteState` was returing false for it, because we haven't unumted the tracked physical device.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the new callback logic.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Closes:** #xxx\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

See \ud83d\udc23 Breaking Changes for how to adapt your workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Going forward, if you have <code>suppress_push_for_open_pull_request: 1</code> in your workflow, you should probably change it to <code>suppress_push_for_open_pull_request: ${{ github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]' &amp;&amp; 1 }}</code> see <a href=\"https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Suppress-PR-check-when-workflow-changes\">Suppress PR check when workflow changes\n</a>.</p>\n<h2>\ud83d\udc23 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<h3>\ud83d\udddc\ufe0f <a href=\"https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Breaking-Change%3A-Reorganized-cspell-Dictionaries-in-v0.0.22\">Reorganized cspell Dictionaries</a></h3>\n<p><code>cspell:</code> dictionaries have been reorganized.</p>\n<h4>Background</h4>\n<p>There are 3 related configuration items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>dictionary_source_prefixes</code>\n<ul>\n<li>In <code>v0.0.21</code>, this had: <code>&quot;cspell&quot;: &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220816/dictionaries/&quot;</code></li>\n<li>In <code>v0.0.22</code>, it has: <code>&quot;cspell&quot;: &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20230509/dictionaries/&quot;</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>extra_dictionaries</code></li>\n<li><code>check_extra_dictionaries</code>\n<ul>\n<li>The list has changed between <code>v0.0.21</code> and <code>v0.0.22</code>, a bunch have moved, some have split, and a bunch have been added.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Migrating</h4>\n<p>You can migrate in a couple of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming you haven't set <code>dictionary_source_prefixes</code>, you can <em>temporarily</em> clear <code>extra_dictionaries</code> and <code>check_extra_dictionaries</code> and then use one run to get a new set of recommended <code>extra_dictionaries</code> and then set <code>check_extra_dictionaries</code> (typically to <code>''</code>).</li>\n<li>If you want to keep your current cspell <code>extra_dictionaries</code>, change <code>cspell</code> to <code>cspell_old</code> (or anything that isn't <code>cspell</code>) and set <code>dictionary_source_prefixes</code> to something like this: <code>{&quot;cspell&quot;: &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220816/dictionaries/&quot;, &quot;cspell_old&quot;: &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220427/dictionaries/&quot;}</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the <code>main</code> branch for <code>check-spelling/cspell-dicts</code> will move (roughly at the time of the <code>v0.0.22</code> release and again for future releases).</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Breaking-change%3A-Dropping-printf-special-cases\">Dropping printf special cases</a></h3>\n<h4>Background</h4>\n<p>check-spelling has evolved from a <a href=\"https://github.com/jsoref/spelling/blob/5ad4784ec4402209dd3bee028e0c87f1dee174a4/w\">very simple script</a> that <a href=\"https://github.com/jsoref/spelling/blob/5ad4784ec4402209dd3bee028e0c87f1dee174a4/w#L33\">included some special handling for <code>\\r</code>/<code>\\t</code>/<code>\\n</code></a> because it was originally developed to focus on C++ and similar files. Over time, check-spelling has been used on many repositories where these patterns can appear in contexts where they aren't C style escapes, and thus it has outgrown this assumption.</p>\n<h4>Migrating</h4>\n<p>You can copy the code from:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/blob/b968ca32e0e5961a85c7fe3e9431f81553c3f434/.github/actions/spelling/candidate.patterns#L591-L595\">https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/blob/b968ca32e0e5961a85c7fe3e9431f81553c3f434/.github/actions/spelling/candidate.patterns#L591-L595</a> into <code>candidate.patterns</code> and consider one of those patterns is the appropriate pattern to include in your configuration.</p>\n<p>If you have workarounds for the old behavior, you should be able to remove them.</p>\n<h3>\ud83d\udc94 <a href=\"https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Breaking-Change%3A-Dropping-support-for-broken-act\">Dropping support for broken act</a></h3>\n<h4>Background</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nektos/act\">nektos/act</a> is an alternate implementation of the GitHub Actions api environment. Each of check-spelling, GHA, and act have bugs and evolve at different rates (check-spelling releases on by far the slowest cycle). check-spelling had some workarounds for quirks of <code>act</code> from a long time ago and those interacted badly with newer GHA behaviors. In order to simplify life, support for some of those quirks has been removed.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Each of check-spelling, GHA, and act have bugs and evolve at different rates (check-spelling releases on by far the slowest cycle). check-spelling had some workarounds for quirks of <code>act</code> from a long time ago and those interacted badly with newer GHA behaviors.

(This was neat: if the filename is only ASCII then the app gets activated as \"File\" activation but if there are non-ASCII characters, then it activates as \"Protocol\" but you'd only ever know this if you are under a debugger.)\r\n- Adds a workaround that makes sure that we close the TextBox's context menu is closed when closing the app, to prevent a crash.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

Also, you can create a profile (set of environment variables) to apply multiple variables at once. Applying the profile adds variables to User env variables.

In practice haven't observed a situation where all of the first `SendMessage(WM_ICON,  ...)` attempts have failed.\r\n\r\nOne thing that bugs me is that if attempts to get the window icon fails and the process file path has a length greater than 1000, it will always show the `SystemIcons.Application` fallback because the buffer used for `QueryFullProcessImageName` is capped at 1000 characters. Might want to retry the query with an increased buffer size if it fails instead.",

This seems to be caused by the fact that those entries depend on the \"SecondaryIsEnabledTextBlockStyle\", which seems to no longer be based on the decault \"IsEnabledTextBlock\" control style after we moved Themes/General.xaml to another directory (\"Themes/General.xaml\" is magic).\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we set specific style names to the IsEnabledTextBlock control instead of relying on defaults.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** #27905\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

It's not possible to control the original window through the thumbnail but it has good compatibility.\r\n- Reparent - Creates a cropped window and puts the original window inside with the client area being what was selected to crop the window.

It happens only on PT update. Registry entries in `Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\NotifyIconSettings` are not being removed properly for some reason. On uninstall every single entry (even the old-version ones) are being removed properly, but only after explorer.exe restart. Because of this my best guess is that explorer has something cached for tray icons between uninstall and install in update scenario and because of that reg entry is not removed (maybe because the exe file it points to still exists - new version installed it again).\r\n\r\nUsing guid to identify tray icon instead of old logic (uID + hwnd) makes update work properly when PT is installed first time. Mentioned workaround is still needed to remove old entries.\r\n\r\nI tried removing the icon explicitly by calling NotifyShellIcon with NIM_DELETE arg, but didn't help neither.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** #24502\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

I do not know what verbiage or configuration conventions/idioms the PowerToys team prefers, I didn't see any clear guidelines in the docs (please let me know if I missed them!), and I wasn't able to get a clear answer in the issue in the last 2 weeks, so I am completely open to reworking the configuration UX however the team prefers.\r\n\r\nAdjusted crosshairs drawing logic to check if fixed length is enabled and draw accordingly, which involved extending the crosshair border beyond the far side when using a fixed length.  I also consolidated the crosshairs drawing logic/calculation a bit as expressions were repeated in several places.  I chose to use inline scopes to ensure no temporary variables from one crosshairs component leaked into others; I am, of course, open to changing it if this violates some policy (I didn't see one).\r\n\r\nNote: For screen edge interaction, I felt it was most intuitive to have the crosshairs extend onto adjacent monitors in fixed-length mode.  This makes the locating the crosshairs during the transition between monitors easier- instead of popping onto the next monitor, it transitions smoothly (or as smoothly as can be expected, in the case of different-resolution monitors).\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\nDid not see any existing automated testing.\r\n\r\nEnabled toggle and configured various fixed lengths with various crosshairs borders configurations.  Ensured the toggle was not enabled by default when transitioning between the current version of PowerToys and a version containing these updates.  Checked interaction with all 4 edges of the screen using a multi-monitor setup and configuring Windows monitors accordingly.",

Start build PowerToysInstaller.wixproj\r\n2. PowerToysInstaller.wixproj calls the HeatDirectory action to create MonacoSRC.wxs file\r\n3. Build the PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj dependency\r\n4. PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj calls generateMonacoWxs.ps1 to edit MonacoSRC.wxs for user installer.\r\n5. Build of PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj ends\r\n6. Build of PowerToysInstaller.wixproj continues and then finishes.\r\n\r\nHowever, in release CI, we run the PowerToysSetupCustomActions build before the installer so that we can sign the custom action dll.\r\nSo the workflow runs like this instead:\r\n1. Start build PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj\r\n2. PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj calls generateMonacoWxs.ps1 to edit MonacoSRC.wxs for user installer.\r\n3. Build of PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj ends\r\n4. Sign PowerToysSetupCustomActions.dll\r\n5. Start build PowerToysInstaller.wixproj\r\n6. PowerToysInstaller.wixproj calls the HeatDirectory action to create MonacoSRC.wxs file\r\n7. Build of PowerToysInstaller.wixproj continues and then finishes.\r\n\r\nAs we can the, the order in release CI will result in a undesirable state.\r\n\r\nIn order to have this run properly, we move the call of generateMonacoWxs.ps1 to PowerToysInstaller.wixproj so that's independent of PowerToysSetupCustomActions.vcxproj.\r\n\r\nThis is the desired workflow this PR tries to achieve on all build scenarios:\r\n1. Start build PowerToysInstaller.wixproj\r\n2. PowerToysInstaller.wixproj calls the HeatDirectory action to create MonacoSRC.wxs file\r\n3. PowerToysInstaller.wixproj calls generateMonacoWxs.ps1 to edit MonacoSRC.wxs for user installer.\r\n4. Build of PowerToysInstaller.wixproj continues and then finishes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

        "body": "## Summary of the Pull Request\r\nThis PR puts every application into two directories, as a way to save space when installed.\r\nMost applications go to the same path as PowerToys.exe\r\nWinUI3 apps go to a separate folder, because the windows app sdk build process overwrites dlls from other applications.\r\n\r\nThis means more discipline in the future so that we don't create colliding dependencies and assets. Some CI steps were added to prevent the easy ones to spot, but more can be added.\r\n\r\nThe x64 PowerToys 0.71 release reports 1.15 GB in the \"Installed apps\" screen and 3.10 GB in the File Explorer properties for the installation folder.\r\nThe x64 release installer for this PR reports 761 MB in the \"Installed apps\" screen and 538 MB in the File Explorer properties screen for the installation folder.\r\nThis means a ~34% size reduction in the \"Installed apps\" screen and a ~83% size reduction in the size reported by the File Explorer properties screen.\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- Udpate the contributing docs to mention the new limitations when developing utilities.\r\n- Try new strategies to merge WinUI 3 applications with the others.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** #27215\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\nThe new CI scripts run correctly.\r\nInstalled and verified every PowerToy is working.\r\nAlso checked that no images seem to be missing.\r\nBuild a 0.70.58 installer so that I could test updating from 0.70.0 to that one and then use the auto-updater to update to 0.71.0 from the official release.\r\n\r\nNote: Switching the location of explorer extensions (like context menus and preview handlers) may require restarting explorer and prevhost. This is not a new bug and would occur as well when for example switching between machine and user installs. Plan for this right now is to show a toast notification to ask to restart the computer after updating, but that's for another PR.",

Sorry for not separating changes to small commits.\r\nI want to discuss UI decisions and code changes to make this PR good and reasonable.\r\nAnd I need help about tests.\r\nAnd I hope the PR Checklist will be filled more :)\r\n\r\nFeatures ended up in this PR:\r\n- Always-on pointer.\r\n    Its behavior is...\r\n    - Always-on pointer is activated while both left and right click are not pressed.\r\n    - Always-on pointer disappears immediately when left/right click is pressed.\r\n    - When left/right click pointer is disabled and that mouse button is pressed, always-on pointer keeps on.\r\n- Left click, right click and always-on pointer can now have different color and opacity.\r\n- Left click, right click and always-on pointer can now be disabled independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the UI decisions and codes I need comments:\r\n\r\n1. I added ARGB color picker UI so that we can set different opacity to each color.\r\nThis is because I realized that if we use always-on pointer, we might want each color have different opacity or even want the same color but with different opacity with left/right click pointer and always-on pointer.\r\nThis also lets us disable each pointer separately.\r\nDoes ARGB picker helpers need new tests? If so, how and where to add?\r\n\r\n2. No toggle buttons to disables the pointer. Instead, disable them by setting their alpha 0.\r\nTo retain the original behavior, I wanted to make an option to disable always-on pointer.\r\nI thought we can have toggle buttons for each pointer but, that would mess up the UI.\r\nAnd anyway we want to disable the pointer when its alpha is 0 because original implementation and my patch don't free pointers after they faded away and I want to at least reduce the leaks.\r\n\r\n3. Is the migration code from settings version <1.1 correct?\r\nI'm not sure how to handle migration correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\n\r\nCompiled with Visual Studio Community 2022, and activated Mouse Highlighter.\r\nPicked colors for each pointers and clicked many times\r\n\r\nI observed:\r\n- always-on pointer behaves as described here\r\n- each pointer can have different color and opacity\r\n- each pointer can be disabled\r\n- the colors were saved correctly after restart\r\n- there was no crash while picking color or clicking",

To solve that we have to bring our MouseHighlighter window to top position again, after the pinned window processes the mouse event. To do that a timer is started on mouse down event (when we draw the highlighter circles), the timer period is set to 10 ms. After the timer rings we bring our window to the front again. As we experience that it takes 0-30 ms that the pinned window hides our window, we await 5 timer ticks (50 ms together) and then we stop the timer. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\n\r\nWe're still receiving issues where the app.dark.png image is missing after an upgrade.\r\n\r\nIn reality, we don't even use the launcher app \"app.dark.png\" file for anything I'd consider useful. All we do with it is load it at startup into the cache assuming it'll be used generally by the plugins as the default icon and free the handle. However, we've changed it so that each plugin uses its own default icon so it seems like this is no longer useful. We still use \"app_error.dark.png\" and its light equivalent as the default error icon when we can't find an image or thumbnail.\r\n\r\nSo what was causing the file to remain locked? I've used sysinternals Process Explorer to understand the usage of the file and verified that indeed the process has a handle for the app.dark.png file \ud83e\udd14 But only that file in the Images folder.\r\nIt turns out that MainWindow.xaml is using app.dark.png as the icon for the Window, which isn't even visible. I've never been able to replicate having that file locked past uninstall or closing the PowerLaunch app but it's possible that it might happen if there's some sort of debug tool listing windows and showing their icons? Hard to know at this point.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes \"app.dark.png\" and \"app.light.png\" from the main launcher app and any variables that seemed to use those file. They weren't referenced anywhere, anyway.\r\nIt also removes the icon from MainWindow.xaml, which should never be visible, anyway.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** #19871 \r\n- [x] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

Isolating the issue showed that using the following XAML instead of the current PowerRename's ExplorerItems was still crashing when scrolling with 1K+ items:\r\n\r\n```xaml\r\n        <ListView.ItemTemplate>\r\n            <DataTemplate>\r\n                <CheckBox />\r\n            </DataTemplate>\r\n        </ListView.ItemTemplate>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, simply using WinUI's `CheckBox` causes the app to crash, as was [noted previously](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/18478#issuecomment-1544439339). Using a `DataTemplate` with a `CheckBox` instead of wrapping it in a `UserControl` makes the behavior much better, but it's still possible to crash it. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the scrolling starts to slow down and end up unusable. Sampling the call stack shows it happens somewhere in the DirectComposition layer:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n>\tMicrosoft::UI::Composition::AnimationBindingManager::UnregisterAllAnimationTargets()\tUnknown\r\n \tMicrosoft::UI::Composition::Visual::Destroy(void)\tUnknown\r\n \tMicrosoft::WRL2::ContextRuntimeClass::ProcessDestroyWorkflow(bool,bool *)\tUnknown\r\n \tMicrosoft::UI::Composition::VisualCommon::CleanUpAllChildren(void)\tUnknown\r\n \tMicrosoft::UI::Composition::Visual::Destroy(void)\tUnknown\r\n```\r\n\r\nInspecting Live Visual Tree has shown that UI virtualization is also active: the number of `ListViewItem`s doesn't grow beyond a certain number. Explicitly setting `VirtualizingStackPanel` as a `ListView.ItemsPanel` didn't make a difference.\r\n\r\n2. By copying [the style](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/210349d9d1e0aeb8ee144ec027071a68ac578bdb/dev/CommonStyles/CheckBox_themeresources.xaml#L376) directly into PowerRename App.xaml's resources it's evident that the element that's causing that is `<animatedVisuals:AnimatedAcceptVisualSource />` of `AnimatedIcon`, i.e. the check mark icon.\r\n\r\nLooking at [the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/animated-icon#add-an-animatedicon-to-a-button), we can find [the line responsible for not using animation](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/210349d9d1e0aeb8ee144ec027071a68ac578bdb/dev/AnimatedIcon/AnimatedIcon.cpp#L431), but it doesn't make a difference when turning off the animations (Accessibility -> Visual Effects -> Animation effects). I haven't found a way to force Fallback animation, so I've removed the AnimatedIcon by overriding CheckBox's Style and [filed an issue in WinUI repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/8604).\r\n\r\n3. Now, trying to add many items using `DEBUG_BENCHMARK_100K_ENTRIES` resulted in an OOM on my system, because each element of vec<`ExplorerItem`> is a `UserControl`, thus `ExplorerItemsSource` and `ExplorerItemViewModel` were implemented to support data virtualization and is essentially a proxy to `IPowerRenameManager`'s items. \r\n5. For some reason, `x:Bind` doesn't work in the context of `DataTemplate` when binding `ExplorerItem`'s properties to `ExplorerItemViewModel`'s properties with the same name, so I've added VM suffices to the property names accordingly.\r\n\r\n6. Using parallel `std::sort` increased startup performance from 80seconds to 30seconds.\r\n\r\n7. OnAdded and OnUpdated events are no longer needed anymore, as well as ExplorerItemsMap.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

It allows the user to get both their IPv6 and IPv4 address at the same time. If the user doesn't have IPv6, it will just tell them that they do not have an IPv6 address (this is done using a try/catch). The user can also press enter to copy the selected result to the clipboard, whether that is their IPv6 or IPv4. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/57069715/d4cad2a0-091e-4abf-b9bd-999dcb66ebc6)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-06-05 120001](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/57069715/a23862b4-35aa-49bd-8e1b-f15590323f95)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\n\r\nThis PR fix file preview pane flickering issues in the File Explorer Addon for MonacoPreview, SvgPreview and MarkdownPreview. These previews utilize WebView2, which has been causing the flickering issues. The problems occur during file selection and resizing the file preview pane.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, the PR applies [a fix from the Peek module](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/26342/files), following the suggestion of @crutkas. This fix flickering after the file preview loading screen is removed and before the file content is displayed (refer to the blue flickering [in the video](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/26683979/11df11b4-affb-49a1-8a31-396c0d150588)). However, it does not fix the flickering that when the user changes file selection or resizes the file preview pane. Because the flickering is not related to the WebView2 background color, as it occurs before the WebView is created.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the remaining issues, two modifications were made. Firstly, the background color was set for the parent window (fix green flickering [in the video](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/26683979/11df11b4-affb-49a1-8a31-396c0d150588)). Secondly, the background color was set in the form, after invoking the handler executable (fix red flickering [in the video](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/26683979/11df11b4-affb-49a1-8a31-396c0d150588)).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x]  **Closes:** #20436\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

File selection test: I select multiple files repeatedly and select the files then select folder repeatedly\r\n4. File preview pane resizing test: I resize the pane slowly and rapidly to check for any flickering\r\n5.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\nThis PR adds a plugin to the Run utility for generating GUIDs, hashing and base64 encoding strings. It also should make it fairly easy to add other value generators in the future.\r\n\r\n~I have not written any tests for this yet and only tested the functionality manually.~ There are unit tests for the GUID generator and for the input parser.\r\n\r\nIt supports the following hashing functions:\r\n- MD5\r\n- SHA1\r\n- SHA256\r\n- SHA384\r\n- SHA512\r\n\r\nAnd GUID/UUID versions 1, 3, 4 and 5. I skipped version 2, but if anyone thinks it would be helpful, it could be added.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, usage is not very obvious from the outset. \r\nI couldn't think of a way to make it very obvious what hashing functions are supported.\r\nAlso, GUID v3 and v5 take exactly 2 parameters - a namespace and a name, separated by space. There are predefined values for the namespace (`ns:DNS`, `ns:URL`, `ns:OID`, `ns:X500`), but any valid GUID would work. I couldn't think of a way to make this obvious either. Suggestions and opinions are welcome!\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n- Generating a random GUID/UUID. Both `guid` and `uuid` keywords are valid and will do the same thing. The query is not case sensitive.\r\n![guid_basic_ss](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/685f68d4-9826-48d6-99c4-b1170e43cc61)\r\n![uuid_basic_ss](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/4e55cd77-cdba-4934-8ec1-d5c25e1ead87)\r\n\r\n- Generating a time based GUID/UUID (version 1)\r\n![time_based_guid](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/fb049d31-7796-4660-b7e2-40c2c634ccbe)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Generating a v3 GUID/UUID for the DNS predefined namespace and name `www.microsoft.com`. Notice the `v` after `guid/uuid` is optional. `guid4` === `guidv4`\r\n![guid_v3_ss](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/f4242315-a92d-4fce-b7a8-5ba1e3f167f5)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Generating a v3 GUID/UUID for a random namespace and name `www.microsoft.com`\r\n![Short screen recording](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/7242f200-99f1-47dc-897b-545ce07c2298)\r\n\r\n- Calculating the MD5 hash for 'abc'\r\n![md5_ss](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/1f1fef0e-b0e1-4cf0-afb7-dc4b6e7c9118)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Calculating the SHA1 hash for 'abc'.\r\n![sha1_ss](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/c3c817b7-5dd2-4183-bb80-32be9b78bcba)\r\n\r\n- Base64 encoding the string 'abcd'\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/assets/22452178/975a18ec-8ca9-46d4-9746-a67021c19f8f)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** #24931\r\n- [x] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

This also affects every hard link to those dlls that is created by installer.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some more executables to terminate when installing/uninstalling PowerToys. We expect this might make the problem better in the future.

Then ones currently available are Cmd, PowerShell and RunCommand.\r\n\r\nEven though in Windows 11, PowerToys opens WindowsTerminal by default when running terminal commands (by \">\") as Non-Administrator, when running the command as an Administrator (Ctrl+Shift+Enter by default), it opens the old Powershell GUI as Administrator. In Windows 10, it is worse, since there is no way to open WindowsTerminal by using \">\" commands.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution alleviates this problem in Windows 11, by launching wt.exe specifically and also allows Windows 10 users to always use WindowsTerminal when executing commands.\r\n\r\nWhat I am proposing is a change to the Shell plugin. I have added a fourth option to the ExecutionShell enum: WindowsTerminal with enum value 3.\r\nWhen option 3 is selected in the config, the proposed code starts up WindowsTerminal by running \r\n``wt.exe powershell -NoExit \"{command}\"`` with or without ``-NoExit``, depending on the LeaveShellOpen setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is my first time submitting a pull request. I read through all the rules but I probably messed something up, so please be kind. :)   Also I made the change because I needed it, but realized there was an open issue, so no harm in submitting a PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\n\r\nI have tested this change on two different machines, one running Windows 11, and one running Windows 10. I did it by only replacing the compiled Shell Plugin .dll file, into a latest version stable install. Then, in my normal installation of PowerToys, I was able to use the new feature, since it is a just a small change, localized to just that plugin.\r\n\r\nI did the same on the other PC and have not encountered any issues with the code. \r\n",

This state can be seen in logs coming out of nowhere by searching for `fancyzones:\"false\"`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior.
