        "body": "Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/194909\r\n\r\nThis bug was causing things to get a higher score than they deserved.\r\n\r\nAlso, in order to get the smoke tests to pass this also introduces a new `exactLabelMatch` property to `runCommand`.\r\n\r\n### Full Context\r\n\r\nThe smoke tests install some extensions and they type `workbench.extensions.action.focusExtensionsView` into the Command Palette which causes a certain command to show up that puts focus in the extension view so the extensions can be installed.\r\n\r\nthe `runCommand` had retry logic and would pick the first result of the quick pick regardless of what it is.\r\nPreviously, if you were to type something like a command name (`workbench.extensions.action.focusExtensionsView`), chances are it wouldn\u2019t match any command except for the one command with that id\u2026if there were no results, it was because the command wasn\u2019t registered yet\u2026so because of the retry logic, that eventually would work as we wait for VS Code to actually register that command.\r\nbut with the similar commands feature, now things start to match in cases it didn\u2019t match previously\u2026 and in this case, it\u2019s matching things on the first try because those commands are actually registered when the one we\u2019re actually looking for isn\u2019t registered yet.\r\n\r\nBefore my fix to TF-IDF chunking `'workbench.extensions.action.focusExtensionsView'` still matched nothing in TF-IDF (similar commands)\u2026 so the tests still pass\u2026 but once I tweaked the TF-IDF chunk, suddenly things were matching\u2026 and that caused the smoke test to fail.\r\n\r\nI had 5 ideas for fixing this:\r\n\r\nSmoke Test change ideas:\r\n* have runCommand use the label of the command instead of the id and wait for exact label match.\r\n* have the smoke tests wait more before starting\r\nCommand Palette change ideas:\r\n* have a setting to disable similar commands in the smoke tests because it\u2019s getting in the way\r\n* introduce a new `@id:` prefix (similar in the Extension Pane) in the command palette that will look up the command id and do nothing else\r\nExtension change ideas:\r\n* extensions stuff needs to be registered more eagerly\r\n\r\nThis is the first one on the list since it's the most straightforward.",

Do we want to add maybe a subset of it (just the description property)?\n\nAdditionally, I noticed that the concept of a LocalizedString isn't a thing in the monaco API... so that would be _another_ thing to introduce.\n\nShould we add these types?
