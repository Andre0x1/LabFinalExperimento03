        "body": "##### Summary\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to fix the missing `system.net` metric when installing Netdata inside an LXC container. This metric is used in the \"Nodes\" tab.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`system.net` is the total bandwidth of all **physical** network interfaces.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/1316c2e225887452ea1307f0657816ea63e64ee7/collectors/proc.plugin/proc_net_dev.c#L849-L852\r\n\r\n`eth0` is virtual\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat /proc/net/dev | grep eth\r\n  eth0: 341815351  238042    0    0    0     0          0         0 13462360  125371    0    0    0     0       0          0\r\n\r\n$ ls -l /sys/devices/virtual/net/ | grep eth\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Oct 10 22:19 eth0\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore it is not taken into account when calculating `system.net`. But Netdata installed in the LXC container is supposed to monitor this container, not the host system. So from that point of view `eth0` is real.\r\n\r\nThis \"double-linked\" logic is the same one we use in [cgroup-network](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/1316c2e225887452ea1307f0657816ea63e64ee7/collectors/cgroups.plugin/cgroup-network.c#L126). \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\n- Install ND inside an LXC container.\r\n- Check `system.net` - should exist.\r\n- Check the `interface_type` label value of `eth0` - should be `real`.\r\n\r\n##### Additional Information\r\n<!-- This is usually used to help others understand your\r\nmotivation behind this change.

With the way it works, the cloud will receive the new alert and then the REMOVED.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an additional check when it queues REMOVED events.

Such distributor can build the dashboard separately, copy the files in, and then run the above snippet to integrate the build into the tree.\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\nRun `./bundle_dashboard_v1.py v3.0.1`. Observe using `git status` (or equivalent) that it doesn't produce any changed files.\r\n\r\n##### Additional Information\r\n\r\nMinified code is widely considered to be a form of compiled code. As the dashboard is also licensed under GPLv3 [1], Linux distributions will have to also distribute the corresponding source code. Some more strict distributions (such as Debian) also requires that the code shipped is built from the said source. This change is 1 of the steps that will make Linux distributions' life easier.\r\n\r\n[1] Actually, I'm not sure what license the dashboard is. See https://github.com/netdata/dashboard/issues/466",

If they can see it, where? no\r\n- How is the user impacted by the change? A better control for socket function.\r\n- What are there any benefits of the change?  Users can control better the functions, and it also give conditions for netdata to close a plugin using functions.\r\n</details>",

When deserializing page we perform one allocation and patch the pointers to each buffer.\r\n- Overall, compression ratio is around ~75%. Two new charts where added under `Netadata monitoring`. One of them shows the number of gorilla buffers we allocate per second, and the other shows the overall savings prior to sending data for compression.\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\nThis PR has been running on parent 3 for a couple weeks now. The intention is to merge this without changing the default page type.\r\n\r\n##### Additional Information\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/netdata/netdata/assets/25480816/f2b88221-9424-4c9d-8258-be626de5dd4c\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n",

It requires using a rootless container runtime (either Podman or rootless Docker, run as a regular user other than root) to attempt to build one of our native packages, but the failure is only observed with some target distributions (CentOS 7 is the only one I\u2019ve currently confirmed to be affected, but I suspect it affects most of the other target distributions as well), and it may be dependent specific aspects of configuration of the build host as well.\r\n\r\nOn affected setups without this PR, error messages should be seen complaining about failing to change file ownership when extracting tarballs.\r\n\r\nOn affected setups with this PR, the above-mentioned errors should not be seen.",

        "body": "##### Summary\r\n\r\nThis adds new logic to the updater so that users can opt-out of updating to specific new major versions of Netdata. A new updater configuration variable called `NETDATA_ACCEPT_MAJOR_VERSIONS` has been added, which should contain a list of major version numbers that we\u2019re allowed to update to. This will by default be populated by us in the updater itself, allowing us to easily block specific major versions if we discover serious issues, and also allowing us to have updates run by default \r\n\r\nNot specifying anything in the updater config file should get behavior exactly equivalent to the current behavior.\r\n\r\nSetting `NETDATA_ACCEPT_MAJOR_VERSIONS` in the updater config file so that it doesn\u2019t include the target major version should cause a non-interactive update to fail, or an interactive update to prompt the user about whether they really want to update.\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\nThere are functionally two code paths to test:\r\n\r\n1. Local builds\r\n2. Static builds\r\n\r\nLocal builds  and static builds can be tested as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Install a current version of Netdata using the kickstart script with the appropriate option (`--build-only` for local builds, `--static-only` for static builds) on the test system.\r\n2. Prepare a test directory in a location of your choice, either on the test system or a separate system the test system can communicate with over the network.\r\n3.  Set up a web server (any web server works) to serve the test directory from step 2 to the test system. The test directory should be at the root of the web server for these tests.\r\n4. Prepare the update file that will be used for testing:\r\n    - For local builds, check out the agent repository and then run `autoreconf -ivf && ./configure && make dist` in the agent repository. This will produce a file with a name like `netdata-v1.42.0-100-gb67882aee.tar.gz`, which is the update file that will be used in the next step.\r\n    - For static builds, check out the agent repository and then run `packaging/makeself/build-static.sh $(uname -m)` (if not building on the test system, replace `$(uname -m)` with the output of `uname -m` run on the test system). This will produce a file with a name like `netdata-x86_64-v1.42.0-100-gb67882aee.gz.run` in a directory called `artifacts`, which is the update file that will be used in the next step.\r\n5. Create a directory called `download/v9999.0.0` in the test directory from step 2. It should contain:\r\n    - The update file produced in step 4.\r\n    - A symbolic link pointing to the update file from step 4 with the same name as the update file from step for with the version in the filename replaced by `latest`. For example, if the update file is named `netdata-x86_64-v1.42.0-100-gb67882aee.gz.run`, then the symbolic link should be `netdata-x86_64-latest.gz.run`.\r\n    - A file called `sha256sums.txt`, generated by running `sha256sum -b ./* > ./sha256sums.txt` from in the `download/lv9999.0.0` directory.\r\n6. Create a second directory called `latest` in the test directory from step 2. It should contain a single file called `latest-version.txt` containing the exact text `v9999.0.0`.\r\n7. Run the updater script from this PR on the test system like so: `NETDATA_BASE_URL=\"<server-url>\" ./netdata-updater.sh --no-updater-self-update`. Replace `<server-url>` with the full URL for the web server set up in step 3.\r\n\r\nBehavior of the updater script should match what is described in the summary section above.\r\n\r\n##### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis _MUST_ be merged before any version 2.0 functionality is merged.\r\n\r\nFurther PRs will be made later to provide the ability to update to a specific version of the agent and to allow updating to the latest release of a given major version.",

In the cases that the relationship is 1:1, the collector README is made into a symlink pointing to the single file in the `integrations` folder.\r\n\r\n  The choice to place the files inside a directory was made to have a uniform way of storing data collection integration documentation. \r\n\r\n  If we were updating the README directly, there could not be a straightforward and neat way to represent collectors that provide more than one integration, hence not being able to populate only one README. @ilyam8 please check this and let me know if you have any arguments, as the go repo will change as well, some READMEs will become symlinks.\r\n\r\n  Then as a QOL feature, when it makes sense, a symlink is made to the outer README.\r\n- For exporters: updates the README of the respective exporter.\r\n- For notifications:\r\n  - For agent notifications: updates the README of the respective notification.\r\n  - For cloud notifications: creates markdown files at `integrations/cloud-notifications`.\r\n\r\nWe could resort throwing the .md files on a docs folder, but I think it would make this super confusing having generated files and normal markdown files at the same place, you would have to open each one to understand it is auto-generated. (there is a hint inside the file in the form of a comment).\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\nThe script runs locally with the expected result in both the netdata repo and in the go repo.\r\n\r\nI will coordinate with @Ferroin and @tkatsoulas to test the action .yml file too.\r\n",

The `-W sqlite-fix` and `-W sqlite-check` that would trigger this check and attempt to rebuild the tables are no longer needed and have been removed.\r\n\r\nA `database corrupted` error may occur during runtime (but not during init) and in this case a recovery will happen when the agent restarts (it will create a `.netdata-meta.db.recover` file to signal that recovery should be attempted).\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\nTest 1\r\n  - Stop the agent \r\n  - Run `netdata -W sqlite-meta-recover`\r\n    - This will access the `netdata-meta.db` file and try to recover as much data is possible. It will create a new `netdata-meta-recover.db` and upon completion it  will be renamed `netdata-meta.db` \r\n\r\nTest 2\r\n  - While the agent is running go to your var/cache/netdata directory and create a `.netdata-meta.db.recover` file (make sure \r\n     netdata will have permissions to delete that file)\r\n  - When you restart the agent, you should notice a recovery attempt in the logfile\r\n",

This PR largely just tweaks a few things for correct compatibility behavior with the new base images.\r\n\r\nNotable changes resulting from this switch:\r\n\r\n- A handful of things that are included in our existing Docker images will no longer be included by default. This is due to package conflicts that are present on Debian but not Alpine. The primary things affected by this are NUT and the APCUPS tooling, both of which will need to be added at runtime if needed.\r\n- In spite of the above change, the image is _larger_ by almost 150 MiB due to both larger numbers of dependencies in Debian and to binary size differences resulting from using glibc instead of musl.\r\n- The existing infrastructure for adding extra packages at runtime has been updated to use a new variable name (it\u2019s now `NETDATA_EXTRA_DEB_PACKAGES` instead of `NETDATA_EXTRA_APK_PACKAGES`). Users who are not utilizing this functionality will see no change. Users who have the old variable defined will see warnings in their container logs about this change, but their containers will still run (albeit without the additional packages specified in the old variable).\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\n~~Docker CI is expected to fail on this PR until https://github.com/netdata/helper-images/pull/223 is merged and the images from that merge are published. That PR should not be merged until this one is otherwise ready to merge, as it will break the existing Docker image build process (specifically, the adduser, addgroup, and usermod changes in this PR are required to get the Docker image to build correctly with the updated base images).~~\r\n\r\nDue to switching to versioned base images, testing for this PR is now no different from testing any other PR making changes to our Docker images.\r\n\r\n##### Additional Information\r\n\r\nPrompted by a desire to have the systemd-journal plugin working in our Docker containers.\r\n\r\nCurrently only build tested, I\u2019ll be doing more rigorous testing tomorrow.",

This saves a bit of time when configuring and makes it even more clear why we\u2019re looking for libsystemd.\r\n- Switch to using pkg-config to check the availability of libsystemd instead of blindly trying to link it directly and assuming specific header paths. This allows easier usage of a libsystemd from a non-root prefix, as well as allowing usage of alternative implementations that use different include or library paths. Notably, this enables using libelogind in place of libsystemd on Alpine Linux to build the systemd-journal plugin.\r\n- If libsystemd cannot be found, try libelogind instead. Alpine Linux provides some compatibility bits to allow pkg-config to correctly identify libelogind as a libsystemd implementation, but some other Linux systems do not. Checking for libelogind allows us to correctly build the systemd-journal plugin on these systems.\r\n\r\n##### Test Plan\r\n\r\nCI passes correctly on this PR.\r\n\r\nDocker images built from this PR include the systemd-journal plugin.",
