I could add to `process` the events `online` and `offline`, if we listen to `online` or `offline`. And then i would set a setInterval with lets say 50ms or 250 ms, and check if there was a status change and emit the corresponding event. Maybe if we have listeners, than instead of directly calling `getOnlineStatus`, we use the last value derived in the `setInterval`. \r\n\r\nBut for now, this is an proposal.

        "body": "A detailed analysis of the cause of this bug is in my linked comment on the corresponding issue. The primary fix is the new setImmediate call in Http2Stream#_destroy, which prevents a re-entrant call into Http2Session::SendPendingData when sending trailers after the Http2Session has been shut down, allowing the trailer data to be flushed properly before the socket is closed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this change, writes can be initiated later in the lifetime of the Http2Session. So, when a JSStreamSocket is used as the underlying socket reference for an Http2Session, it needs to be able to accept write calls after it is closed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, now that outgoing data can be flushed differently after a session is closed, in two tests clients receive errors that they previously did not receive. I believe the new errors are more correct, so I changed the tests to match.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42713\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42713#issuecomment-1756140062\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read:\r\n\r\n- the CONTRIBUTING guide at https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- the commit message formatting guidelines at\r\n  https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

I wasn't sure how it should be added to the license builder.\r\n- There is no sqlite dependency update script.\r\n- There are probably opportunities to optimize the database configuration in the future.\r\n- There are opportunities in the future to make this more configurable (such as a CLI flag to specify the storage location or maximum size).\r\n- Unsure if storage should be accessible from workers. Web workers cannot access them, but Node's worker threads are not quite web workers.\r\n- Since the CI is currently locked down, I'm unsure if sqlite builds on every platform Node.js supports.",

        "body": "Avoid splitting chunked responses into multiple parts when corking. This makes a large difference performance-wise on the client side.\r\n\r\nPreviously when writing to a chunked response Node would create a separate chunk for each call to `.write(...)` regardless whether the response was corked or not. This leads to unnecessary overhead both on the client and server side.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by creating a single chunk for all calls to `write(...)` when uncorking the response.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding#chunked_encoding:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nres.cork();\r\nres.write('Mozilla');\r\nres.write(' Developer Network');\r\nres.uncork();\r\n```\r\n\r\n> At the beginning of each chunk you need to add the length of the current chunk in hexadecimal format, followed by '\\r\\n'  and then the chunk itself, followed by another '\\r\\n'. The terminating chunk is a regular chunk, with the exception that its  length is zero.\r\n\r\nResulting in a response stream looking like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n7\\r\\n\r\nMozilla\\r\\n\r\n18\\r\\n\r\n Developer Network\\r\\n\r\n0\\r\\n\r\n\\r\\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR everything is combined into a single chunk when uncorking the response bypassing a lot of unnecessary overhead.\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n25\\r\\n\r\nMozilla Developer Network\\r\\n\r\n0\\r\\n\r\n\\r\\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/57",

        "body": "There's been quite a few reports of TLSSocket MaxListenersExceededWarning errors for 'close' events in Node v20, particularly with npm (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/6763#issuecomment-1714257930, https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49955, https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49337, https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49269). I've also seen this myself in my node code when using TLS sockets heavily after updating to Node v20.\r\n\r\nThis is intermittent and hard to reliably reproduce. That said, this PR fixes a clear small bug that adds duplicate close listeners to many TLS sockets, which is probably a significant factor here (could be the whole problem, hard to say). Anecdotally, with this change testing locally I haven't seen any more of these messages.\r\n\r\nThe specific line changed here is referenced by quite a few of the reports and in my own output, here's an example stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(node:19864) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 close listeners added to [TLSSocket]. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit\r\n    at _addListener (node:events:588:17)\r\n    at TLSSocket.addListener (node:events:606:10)\r\n    at Readable.on (node:internal/streams/readable:904:35)\r\n    at TLSSocket._wrapHandle (node:_tls_wrap:706:8)\r\n    at TLSSocket.reinitializeHandle (node:_tls_wrap:715:22)\r\n    at internalConnectMultiple (node:net:1123:30)\r\n    at Timeout.internalConnectMultipleTimeout (node:net:1687:3)\r\n    at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:575:11)\r\n    at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:514:7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this specific case, reinitializeHandle is called as part of the autoselect family logic (notably enabled by default in Node v20) where sockets are reinitialized repeatedly to test different addresses.\r\n\r\nThis calls _wrapHandle, which adds a close listener to `this` (the TLS socket) every time. Since this is called repeatedly when testing addresses, that results in adding one additional close listener for the same callback for every reinitialization (i.e. for each detect IPv4 or IPV6 address of the target host). I think there's no functional impact to this bug (it effectively calls destroy multiple times on close, which does nothing after the first call) but it does potentially add lots of unnecessary listeners.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that, so it now only registers this close listener if one is not already present (I think `listenerCount` is the best way to do that, but better alternatives are welcome).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read:\r\n\r\n- the CONTRIBUTING guide at https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- the commit message formatting guidelines at\r\n  https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

To see what this PR adds, go to https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node/compare/better-esm-check\u2026GeoffreyBooth:node:ambiguous-detection\r\n\r\nImplements https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/50064. This PR aims to allow Node.js to allow ES module syntax input by default, without the user needing to opt in by using a non-`.js` extension, a `package.json` `\"type\"` field or a command-line flag. The goal is to make this enabled by default, unflagged, once we consider it stable.\r\n\r\nFor the following \u201cambiguous\u201d inputs:\r\n\r\n- Files with a `.js` extension or no extension; and either no controlling `package.json` or one that lacks a `type` field; and `--experimental-default-type` is not specified\r\n- String input (`--eval` or STDIN) when neither `--input-type` nor `--experimental-default-type` are specified\r\n\r\nNode will do the following:\r\n\r\n- For ambiguous main entry point, either file or string input, the new `containsModuleSyntax` function from #50127 is used to determine whether the CommonJS or ESM loader should handle the main entry. (The ESM loader is used if the main entry contains module syntax.)\r\n- When the ESM loader is handling modules, within the `load` hook, once the source is loaded it will be passed to `containsModuleSyntax` to determine whether the `format` should be `module` or `commonjs` (again, only for the ambiguous inputs specified above).\r\n\r\nThis behavior applies to ambiguous files within `node_modules`. This is to prevent the hazard where a package author writes a library relying on this detection behavior but consumers of the package would fail to load it if they didn\u2019t also have the detection behavior. (Such a hazard will still exist for consumers running old versions of Node, but at least it\u2019s avoided moving forward.)\r\n\r\nThis behavior applies to the main entry point and to files referenced via `import`. It would not apply to files referenced via `require`, because `require` cannot load ES modules.\r\n\r\nThis behavior does not apply to modules with any marker of explicitness: an `.mjs` or `.cjs` extension, a `package.json` with a `type` field, specified `--input-type` or `--experimental-default-type` flags.\r\n\r\nThis behavior does not apply to `--print` input, as `--print` does not support ESM syntax.\r\n\r\nI need to figure out a way to measure the performance impact of this. When enabled, it should have no impact on apps that run without erroring today. Therefore the comparison would be between:\r\n\r\n- An app written in ESM syntax, in `.js` files, using `\"type\": \"module\"`\r\n- That same app, but with a `package.json` file with no `type` field.\r\n\r\nThe other thing we need to confirm is that when enabled, this doesn\u2019t affect any apps that run without erroring today. Or inversely it should have no effect on anything that already runs successfully, and therefore is not a breaking change.\r\n\r\ncc @nodejs/performance @nodejs/loaders @nodejs/tsc",

APIs accepting finalizer callbacks are modified to accept `node_api_nogc_finalize` callbacks. Thus, the only way to attach a `napi_finalize` callback, wherein Node-APIs affecting GC state may be called is to call `node_api_post_finalizer` from a `node_api_nogc_finalize` callback.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the process of introducing new Node-APIs, this feature is guarded by `NAPI_EXPERIMENTAL`. Since this feature modifies APIs already marked as stable, it is additionally guared by `NODE_API_EXPERIMENTAL_NOGC_ENV`, so as to provide a further buffer to adoption. Nevertheless, both guards must be removed upon releasing a new version of Node-API.\r\n",

        "body": "### What problem does this PR solve?\r\nCurrently, in the test CI, we have some tests that fail from time to time which aren't marked as flaky. They can get very annoying, especially when running for PRs, and in some cases, multiple reruns are needed for PR to pass all of the CI checks. This PR aims to at least minimize if not completely remove, the reruns needed.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR solve the problem?\r\nA new parameter, called `--rerun-failures`, is added in the `tools/test.py` script. The inspiration was taken from the `--measure-flakiness` parameter, but while it only measures the flakiness, the new one marks the test as passed if any of the reruns (or the initial run) passes and it only reruns until a rerun passes. When one of the reruns passes the test, that is noted in the output together with a suggestion to mark the test as flaky, and in the diagnostic part, all failed runs previous to that one are logged. Implementation is made in a way that lets us use `--rerun-failures`, `--measure-flakiness`, or both of them together without interfering with each other. `vcbuild.bat` and `Makefile` are changed so that when tests are started from the CI `--rerun-failures=3` is used. 3 is a magic number, which seemed OK as it is neither too low, nor too high, but I'm open to suggestions.",

Use `if-present` to ignore missing scripts.\n*   `@npmcli/agent` is now used as the agent for network requests\n*   the `ci-name` config has been removed\n*   the hard-coded `hashAlgorithm` value is no longer being passed through flatOptions\n*   the unused `tmp` config has been removed\n*   the hard-coded `metrics-registry` config has been removed.\n*   libnpmpublish will no longer attempt a single automatic retry on 409 responses during publish.\n*   support for the strict RFC 8909 mode has been removed. this mode was only enabled when the environ `NPM_PACKAGE_ARG_8909_STRICT=1` was set.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n*   [`e0d3edd`](https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/e0d3edd9908f8303abb9941bdd2f6e9aa31bc9d7) [#6641](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/6641) remove \"ci-name\" config

        "body": "This PR improves the hideStackFrames logic.\r\n\r\nhideStackFrames is used to hide function calls from stracktraces of Errors. E.g. we call `Buffer.alloc(size)`, then we check if the parameter size is an integer and call `validateNumber(size, 'size', 0, kMaxLength);`. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict'\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    Buffer.alloc('1')\r\n} catch (err) {\r\n    console.error(err.stack)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen we get the following stacktrace:\r\n```\r\nTypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"size\" argument must be of type number. Received type string ('1')\r\n    at Function.alloc (node:buffer:393:3)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/aras/workspace/node/test.js:4:12)\r\n    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1369:14)\r\n    at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1427:10)\r\n    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1201:32)\r\n    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1017:12)\r\n    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:104:12)\r\n    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:23:47\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we remove the hideStackFrame wrapping for demonstration purposes we get:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nTypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"size\" argument must be of type number. Received type string ('1')\r\n    at validateNumber (node:internal/validators:177:11)\r\n    at Function.alloc (node:buffer:393:3)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/aras/workspace/node/test.js:4:12)\r\n    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1369:14)\r\n    at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1427:10)\r\n    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1201:32)\r\n    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1017:12)\r\n    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:104:12)\r\n    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:23:47\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we have the additional `    at validateNumber (node:internal/validators:177:11)` entry. \r\n\r\nWe want to hide this frame, as it is some node internal information, and does not give any benefit for the developer. \r\n\r\nJavascript has no `inline` specifier, so we have to hide it differently. In main branch this is solved by prefixing the function name with `__node_internal_`  and then generating the whole stacktrace with `captureLargerStackTrace`, which sets `Error.stackTraceLimit = Infinity`. When we then call Error.stack, prepareStackTrace will filter out the all frames, which start with `__node_internal_`. \r\n\r\nBut we dont need the whole stackTrace. We only need a limited number, by default 10 frames. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this we just generate the necessary stackTrace. \r\n\r\nSo hideStackFrames will wrap the original function and will capture the correct stack trace if an error is thrown. Functions which are wrapped have to call the HideStackFramesError Errors and wont have a Stack trace. \r\n\r\nAn edge case is when a function, which uses hideStackFrames calls another function which is wrapped with hideStackFrames. To avoid double generation of the stack, a function which is wrapped with hideStackFrames exposes a function as attribute of the wrapped function called `.withoutStackTrace`. The outer function will then get the necessary stack trace. \r\n\r\nUsually double wrapped functions are validators. I would have liked to extract them all into validators.js or into module/validators.js. But this would have reduced the readability further. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read:\r\n\r\n- the CONTRIBUTING guide at https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- the commit message formatting guidelines at\r\n  https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

This effectively completes some TODOs in the code that note that particular code paths should be deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe only user-observable effects of this are that, under `--experimental-default-type=module`:\r\n\r\n- Extension searching is no longer provided for the main entry point. Users need to type `node entry.js`, not `node entry`.\r\n- Libraries that were monkey-patching the CommonJS loader via code loaded by `--require` will no longer achieve anything. They weren\u2019t achieving much before, as monkey-patching the CommonJS loader only affects CommonJS and not ES modules, so it\u2019s not like the previous behavior was really working very well (if at all) for applications with an ESM entry point.\r\n\r\nThis inches us closer to actually deprecating the CommonJS loader and having the ESM loader handle all modules, which is a long term goal that will aid in maintainability and future functionality for the modules subsystem.",

This can be done as a semver-minor change because currently such files error when they are within a `module` scope. (Outside of such a scope, they are interpreted as CommonJS modules unless `--experimental-default-type=module` is passed.)\r\n\r\nThis was discussed in the most recent TSC meeting, https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1442. At that meeting it was agreed that this change could go out in 21.0.0, but _not_ immediately in 20.x or below. It doesn\u2019t need to be restricted from 20.x indefinitely, but there was a request to hold off on backporting it to 20.x until it had been public in 21.x for a bit. I\u2019ve added labels accordingly.\r\n\r\n@nodejs/loaders @nodejs/wasi ",

Users can run `node --import ./entry.js?foo=bar` or `node --import data:text/javascript,console.log(\"Hello\")`.\r\n\r\n- It provides a way to run a bare specifier as the main entry point, for example `node --import typescript-repl`.\r\n\r\nThis satisfies the \u201cdefine the main entry point as a URL\u201d part of https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49432.\r\n\r\nSince this is a semver-major change, it cannot be backported. `node --import ./entry.js?foo=bar --eval ''` can achieve very similar results in current and past versions of Node.

        "body": "Previously to throw errors from C++ land, sync versions of the fs were created by copying C++ code from the original implementation and moving JS code to a separate file. This can lead to several problems:\r\n\r\n1. By moving code to a new file for the sake of moving, it would be harder to use git blame to trace changes and harder to backport changes to older branches.\r\n2. Scattering the async and sync versions of fs methods in different files makes it harder to keep them in sync and share code in the prologues and epilogues.\r\n3. Having two copies of code doing almost the same thing results in duplication and can be prone to out-of-sync problems when the prologue and epilogue get updated.\r\n4. There is a minor cost to startup in adding an additional file. This can add up even with the help of snapshots.\r\n\r\nThis patch moves the JS code back to lib/fs.js to stop 1, 2 & 4 and introduces C++ helpers SyncCallAndThrowIf() and SyncCallAndThrowOnError() so that the original implementations can be easily tweaked to allow throwing from C++ and stop 3.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read:\r\n\r\n- the CONTRIBUTING guide at https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- the commit message formatting guidelines at\r\n  https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

We made an attempt\r\nto make that reference known to V8 by making the CompiledFnEntry weak\r\nand using a private symbol to make CompiledFnEntry strongly\r\nreferences the top-level referrer function in\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46785, but that turned out to be\r\nunsound, because the there's no guarantee that the top-level function\r\nmust be alive while import() can still be initiated from that\r\nfunction, since V8 could discard the top-level function and only keep\r\ninner functions alive, so relying on the top-level function to keep\r\nthe CompiledFnEntry alive could result in use-after-free which caused\r\na revert of that fix.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we use a symbol in the host defined options instead of\r\na number, because with the stage-3 symbol-as-weakmap-keys proposal\r\nwe could directly use that symbol to keep the referrer alive using a\r\nWeakMap. As a bonus this also keeps the other kinds of referrers\r\nalive as long as import() can still be initiated from that\r\nScript/Module, so this also fixes the long-standing crash caused by\r\nvm.Script being GC'ed too early when its importModuleDynamically\r\ncallback still needs it.\r\n\r\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/48510\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/44211\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42080\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47096\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43205\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38695\r\nReviewed-By: Antoine du Hamel <duhamelantoine1995@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Stephen Belanger <admin@stephenbelanger.com>\r\n\r\n### module: fix leak of vm.SyntheticModule\r\n\r\nPreviously we maintain a strong persistent reference to the\r\nModuleWrap to retrieve the ID-to-ModuleWrap mapping from\r\nthe HostImportModuleDynamicallyCallback using the number ID\r\nstored in the host-defined options. As a result the ModuleWrap\r\nwould be kept alive until the Environment is shut down, which\r\nwould be a leak for user code. With the new symbol-based\r\nhost-defined option we can just get the ModuleWrap from the\r\nJS-land WeakMap so there's now no need to maintain this\r\nstrong reference. This would at least fix the leak for\r\nvm.SyntheticModule. vm.SourceTextModule is still leaking\r\ndue to the strong persistent reference to the v8::Module.\r\n\r\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/48510\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/44211\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42080\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47096\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43205\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38695\r\nReviewed-By: Antoine du Hamel <duhamelantoine1995@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Stephen Belanger <admin@stephenbelanger.com>\r\n\r\n### module: fix the leak in SourceTextModule and ContextifySript\r\n\r\nReplace the persistent handles to v8::Module and\r\nv8::UnboundScript with an internal reference that V8's GC is\r\naware of to fix the leaks.\r\n\r\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/48510\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/44211\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42080\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47096\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43205\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38695\r\nReviewed-By: Antoine du Hamel <duhamelantoine1995@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Stephen Belanger <admin@stephenbelanger.com>\r\n\r\n### test: add checkIfCollectable to test/common/gc.js\r\n\r\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/49671\r\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Yagiz Nizipli <yagiz@nizipli.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Micha\u00ebl Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\r\n\r\n### test: use checkIfCollectable in vm leak tests\r\n\r\nPreviously we simply create a lot of the target objects and check\r\nif the process crash due to OOM.

This should lower the chance of false positives.\r\nAs a drive-by this also allows us to use setImmediate() to grow the\r\nheap even faster to make the tests run faster.\r\n\r\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/49671\r\nReviewed-By: James M Snell <jasnell@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Benjamin Gruenbaum <benjamingr@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Yagiz Nizipli <yagiz@nizipli.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Micha\u00ebl Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\r\n\r\n### test: deflake test-vm-contextified-script-leak\r\n\r\nSimilar to the test-vm-source-text-module-leak fix, use a snapshot\r\nto force a thorough GC in order to prevent false positives.\r\n\r\nPR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/49710\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/reliability/issues/669\r\nReviewed-By: Franziska Hinkelmann <franziska.hinkelmann@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Micha\u00ebl Zasso <targos@protonmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Luigi Pinca <luigipinca@gmail.com>\r\nReviewed-By: Rich Trott <rtrott@gmail.com>",

        "body": "> This PR contains work by @LiviaMedeiros, @JakobJingleheimer, @bmeck adapted from #49531, #49540, #49295, #41552, #31388.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements most of the proposal in #49432. It creates a new flag, `--experimental-default-type`, which supports values `commonjs` (the default) or `module`. Under `--experimental-default-type=module`, Node.js interprets the following as ES modules:\r\n\r\n* String input provided via `--eval` or STDIN, if `--input-type` is unspecified.\r\n\r\n* Files ending in `.js` or with no extension, if there is no `package.json` file present in the same folder or any parent folder.\r\n\r\n* Files ending in `.js` or with no extension, if the nearest parent `package.json` field lacks a `type` field; unless the folder is inside a `node_modules` folder. \r\n\r\nExtensionless files are interpreted as Wasm if `--experimental-wasm-modules` is passed and the file contains the \u201cmagic bytes\u201d Wasm header.\r\n\r\nThe ESM loader is used for all entry points, and we don\u2019t pass through `Module.runMain`. Under this flag, we no longer support monkey-patching of that method by files loaded via `--require`.\r\n\r\nThis PR does _not_ implement the \u201cparse the entry point as a URL\u201d part of #49432, as there are still some design decisions to be made around that and it\u2019s substantial enough to warrant being implemented as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #49629 and linked PRs, which include the above behaviors for extensionless files but don\u2019t require a flag. I think we can potentially ship that change on its own, separate from making this flag the new default behavior, because extensionless files currently error in `module` scopes. I\u2019d prefer to ship it behind the `--experimental-default-type` flag first to work out any kinks before splitting it out to not require any flag.\r\n\r\nIf people don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like if this PR thread can focus on the implementation. If anyone has any thoughts on the design or intentions behind this, there\u2019s already a detailed thread for that at #49432.\r\n\r\ncc @nodejs/loaders @nodejs/wasi @nodejs/startup @nodejs/tsc \r\n\r\n### Notable change\r\n\r\nThe new flag `--experimental-default-type` can be used to flip the default module system used by Node.js. Input that is already explicitly defined as ES modules or CommonJS, such as by a `package.json` `\"type\"` field or `.mjs`/`.cjs` file extension or the `--input-type` flag, is unaffected. What is currently implicitly CommonJS would instead be interpreted as ES modules under `--experimental-default-type=module`:\r\n\r\n* String input provided via `--eval` or STDIN, if `--input-type` is unspecified.\r\n\r\n* Files ending in `.js` or with no extension, if there is no `package.json` file present in the same folder or any parent folder.\r\n\r\n* Files ending in `.js` or with no extension, if the nearest parent `package.json` field lacks a `type` field; unless the folder is inside a `node_modules` folder. \r\n\r\nIn addition, extensionless files are interpreted as Wasm if `--experimental-wasm-modules` is passed and the file contains the \u201cmagic bytes\u201d Wasm header.",

The message is converted to UTF-8 into the local variable `raw_message`, and then we call `parseMessage` which converts back `raw_message` into UTF-16 and calls `parseJSON` on it.\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids the conversion from UTF-8 back into UTF-16. This should save some processing that is currently done with each key press.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that it is a [Chesterton's fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/) and that the complexity is somehow necessary. Nevertheless, if this PR is correct, it would be an interesting optimization for the REPL. ",

ARM64 compatibility was added with Visual Studio 2022 (17.4.0 or higher)\r\n  - Updated the scripts to use VS2022 Chocolatey Packages\r\n  - Updated the Building docs to use the newest Visual Studio Packages (which are compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11)\r\n- Updated Docs to clarify that folks should first clone the repository and head to the cloned directory.

This restores support for connecting to abstract unix domain sockets. Support was lost due to the refactor in libuv/libuv#4030 where `uv_pipe_bind` and `uv_pipe_connect` now infer the length of the `pathname` using `strlen()`. For an abstract unix socket, this was producing `0`. Moving to `uv_pipe_bind2` and `uv_pipe_connect2` allows us to pass an explicit `size_t` for the socket path based on the length of the v8 string.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49656",
