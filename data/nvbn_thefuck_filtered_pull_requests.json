Not matching on explicit paths:\r\n\r\n* `+` Gives rule authors the ability to match only when an explicit path to the command is given\r\n* `-` Prevents rule authors from matching on a command regardless of what path was given (if any)\r\n\r\nSince the default behavior for `fuck` is to require user interaction before confirming a command, casting a wider net is unlikely to be harmful. \r\n\r\nAlso, the only rule that uses `@for_app` and has a path in the match string that I could find, has the path there because the most common invocation of that tool uses a path and the rule doesn't work otherwise, because of this limitation. In other words, it seems that the only rule that uses a path in the for_app string does so as a work-around to this too-strict behavior. I can only speculate that other rules, including the rm_dir rule, may have avoided the decorator for this reason.\r\n\r\nRule authors should not have to enumerate all the different paths a command could be called from, in my view. Hopefully this has not been litigated previously.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting, consider my commit message to d30a789. It may be better to strip paths in both places, but I'm not sure. Also if you need more tests, let me know where and I'll be happy to add them.",

This is similar to autocompletion, where the wrapped command inherent the parent command's *all* autocompletion.\n\nDifferences between this and the existing alias implementation is that, the aliased command will replaced the correct command. Consider the following\n```sh\n$ alias git=hub\n$ git push\nERROR\n$ fuck\nhub stash; and hub pull [enter/\u2191/\u2193/ctrl+c]\n```\n\nIf I were to alias `yadm` as `git`, `fuck` will corrects it with the wrong executable. Also, this PR allows arbitary commands to take advantage of the existing defined rules for arbitary commands, rather than reinventing the wheel.\n\nAn example config in `~/.config/thefuck/settings.py` would be\n```python\nwraps_commands = {'git': ['yadm', 'hub']}\n```\ni.e. a dictionary that defines `git`'s **other names** that would inherent. Currently, if you were to run `hub` directly without making it as an alias, `thefuck` wouldn't be able to provide correction to it. But if you were to wrap `hub` as `git` it will simply works.\n\nGranted that there are some rules that had hardcoded executable name within it (see some of the modified files in this PR). However, they can be easily swapped with a variable that points to the user-provieded command name.",

        "body": "Hello! I'm a day late for Hacktoberfest but I hope you find this PR useful.\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to fix #959 and add better integration with the [composer](https://getcomposer.org) tool. It turns out the issue of the crash was not because \"there was only one suggestion\" as suggested in the Issue, but rather that the matcher erroneously matches __package not found__ errors instead of just __command not found__ errors. Since the output of the two varies significantly, I have created two separate rules (and tests) for this functionality.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the old tests used outdated test cases from more than 2 years ago (the output has changed in newer versions). I have tested it on newer versions of composer, notably the latest version of composer (`1.7.0`).\r\n\r\n##### Behaviour of issue #959 before fix:\r\n![composer single package old](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SlimOffbeatBonobo-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### After fix:\r\n![composer single package new](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ScaryForsakenLemur-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\nThe original `composer-not-command` was also not comprehensive enough: when multiple suggestions are offered, only one is passed to `thefuck`. This is fixed:\r\n\r\n##### Before\r\n![composer not command multiple old](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MisguidedForcefulAfghanhound-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### After\r\n![composer not command multiple new](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EachDependentBittern-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n(the stray `composer require potato` appears to be a framework issue outside my domain, as my unit tests that tests the suggested commands pass)\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the `composer-not-package` rule, `thefuck` is now alot more accommodating of various user mistakes:\r\n\r\n#### Attempting to `require` an erronous package name with multiple suggestions lets `thefuck` cycle through all suggestions\r\n\r\n##### Before\r\n![composer many package old](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PossibleSpryFreshwatereel-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### After\r\n![composer many package new](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CarefulMindlessAfricanbushviper-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n#### `thefuck` now also respects version constraints, as reflected in the generated suggestions:\r\n\r\n##### Single suggestion + version constraint\r\n![composer single package version constraint](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DescriptiveCourteousBeardedcollie-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n##### Multiple suggestions + version constraint\r\n![composer multiple package version constraint](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/TiredWaterloggedFunnelweaverspider-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Finally, `thefuck` is able to do consecutive `fuck`s with `composer`, such as in the case where the user attempts to `require` several erroneous package names at once:\r\n\r\n![composer consecutive fucks](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/NecessaryWellgroomedAbyssiniancat-size_restricted.gif)\r\n\r\n### Tests & Documentation\r\n\r\nI have revamped the tests with updated output from recent versions of composer. It looks messy but it contains all the different possible scenarios that can result from botched user input. I have tried my best with making the code self documenting with sensible variable names and comments.\r\n\r\n`flake8` does not produce any visible warnings. All tests pass except `test_go_unknown_command.py`, but that test also fails on a fresh clone of the upstream repository so I guess it's not related to my commits.",

And on windows,powershell is supported too.\r\nBut when I try to using it in the cmder's bash(powerful linux-like shell in windows), \r\nthe code section in ```thefuck/utils.py``` didn't work well:\r\n```\r\n@memoize\r\ndef get_all_executables():\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name\r\n            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')\r\n            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])\r\n            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)\r\n            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nThis is due to the python i installed is exactly the windows binary.In the cmder shell, you can call window executable like python and it will automatically parse the PATH to linux format, while, the python interpreter does not. ```os.environ.get(\"PATH\", \"\")``` returns PATH still in windows format, like:\r\n```\r\n'E:\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Library\\\\bin;C:\\\\Users\\\\BurdenBear\\\\bin;'\r\n```\r\nSo i add some code to check if the python interpreter is windows binary by call  ```sys.platform == \"win32\"```. If so, parse the PATH in windows format , and then replace the .exe suffix in bins found in path.\r\n\r\n---\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n$ puthon\r\nbash: puthon: command not found\r\n$fuck\r\nNo fucks given\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n$ puthon\r\nbash: puthon: command not found\r\n$ fuck\r\npython [enter/\u2191/\u2193/ctrl+c]\r\n```\r\n---\r\nI know this may be a devious and strange use case,but as far as i know, these are many people using cmder on windows like me, this may help them.\r\nThanks for review it.",

In both uses of `get_pkgfile` (in pacman.py and in pacman_not_found.py), it would be appropriate for `get_pkgfile` to return an empty list when the `pkgfile` does not find any packages by the correct name. However, the `pkgfile` command returns 1 in these circumstances, and as such `subprocess` raises an exception. Now, when this exception is caused by `pkgfile` returning 1 with no output (when it finds no packages), `get_pkgfile` will not cause a crash.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce bug:\r\n```\r\nyaourt -S e\r\nfuck\r\n```\r\nthen press \u2191 or \u2193",
