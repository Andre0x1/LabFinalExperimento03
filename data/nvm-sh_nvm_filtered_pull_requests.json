        "body": "\r\nIn numerous blog posts regarding the configuration of the default nodejs version using nvm, the following command is often cited:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnvm alias default node\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this command might work in some cases (as `node` will point to the latest version installed on your system), it might not behave as intended if you want to default to a specific version of Node.js. \r\n\r\nThis command is actually referring to the [Set default node version](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/c6e35bae08ac4ea329c36aaaaf951b32a4612d80/README.md#set-default-node-version) section in the nvm's README. It's crucial to note that the instructions suggest setting a specific node version of your choosing, rather than using the generic `node`. \r\n\r\nSo if you're aiming to set a particular version (for example, 14.15.1) as your default, the correct command would be:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnvm alias default 14.15.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the specified version of Node.js will be used by default. If you simply use `node` as in the first command, it could point to any installed version, which might not be what you intend.",

Right now, if `NVM_ARCH` is `armv8l`, it falls back to `armv7l` since `ARMv8` is backward compatible with `ARMv7`.\r\n\r\nI think other approaches are\r\n\r\n- Changing `aarch64) NVM_ARCH=\"arm64\" ;;` pattern to  `aarch64 | armv8l) NVM_ARCH=\"arm64\" ;;`. That way it would step into the following code block and also fall back to `armv7l`.\r\n```\r\n  # If running a 64bit ARM kernel but a 32bit ARM userland,\r\n  # change ARCH to 32bit ARM (armv7l) if /sbin/init is 32bit executable\r\n  if [ \"$(uname)\" = \"Linux\" ] \\\r\n    && ( [ \"${NVM_ARCH}\" = arm64 ] || [ \"${NVM_ARCH}\" = armv8l ] ) \\\r\n    && [ \"$(command od -An -t x1 -j 4 -N 1 \"/sbin/init\" 2>/dev/null)\" = ' 01' ]\\\r\n  ; then\r\n    NVM_ARCH=armv7l\r\n    HOST_ARCH=armv7l\r\n  fi\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Instead of falling back to `armv7l`, create another if block to use `arm64`, something like\r\n```\r\n  if [ \"$(uname)\" = \"Linux\" ] \\\r\n    && [ \"${NVM_ARCH}\" = armv8l ] \\\r\n  ; then\r\n    NVM_ARCH=arm64\r\n    HOST_ARCH=arm64\r\n  fi\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions, feedback, or concerns!",

It is still required that a user's `$NVM_DIR` be a directory where the current user has full access.\r\n\r\nI'm actively using a setup like this throughout the infrastructure I manage and am testing this specific change on a CI server I control.  NVM, while not intending to be multi-user, actually works quite well outside of `nvm exec`, which this PR resolves.\r\n\r\nI've made a few modifications from the original PR.  Namely:\r\n\r\n* Simpler `DIR` determination in `nvm-exec`\r\n* Applied a change recommended by @ljharb on the original PR\r\n* Removed the `tar` flag changes since specific flag applied appears to be the default for all `tar`s I'm aware of and doesn't exist on OpenBSD's `tar`, as far as I could tell.\r\n\r\nWith the changes to the main `nvm` script, I've noticed that it's not even required to have `nvm-exec` symlinked into `$NVM_DIR` when executed as `nvm exec`.  This change could also allow for `nvm-exec` exec to be symlinked into a standard location for binaries (e.g. /usr/local/bin) to provide nvm-exec easily to system processes, though I haven't tested this personally.",

        "body": "TL;DR: `nvm install` fails in Arch's `makepkg` environment when `/sbin/init` does not exist. No idea (yet) why exactly this happens, but slightly modifying the line checking for `/sbin/init` here seems to fix things.\r\n\r\nA few more details/reasoning:\r\n\r\nIn some very rare circumstances, a non-existing `/sbin/init` seems to cause an `nvm install` to fail without any 'good' hint as to why it fails. (It seems like the commit 7f2ccd51d4c20cd23d7ba79e4c19f06c40b68470 made it especially hard to pinpoint what's going on here, because even if things silently fail there, it might still cause a script failure in those circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis could look like this, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDownloading and installing node v14.18.1...\r\nBinary download failed, trying source.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u2026and then nothing more.\r\n\r\nI am not entirely certain what exactly causes it to fail here \u2013 I'd (very broadly) assume that some \"globally\" set shell option from whatever called nvm might still cause the `ls` error to cause the nvm script to exit. I've originally come across it on Arch in `makechrootpkg`, although the main culprit seems to be in `makepkg` itself \u2013 which seems to be enough to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nBasically, it happens when running `makepkg` for a `PKGBUILD` where `nvm` is used (as, for example, recommended at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js_package_guidelines#Using_nvm), when `/sbin/init` does not exist (on Arch it does not exist by default, but is provided by the `systemd-sysvcompat` package).\r\n\r\nI've only come across it by accident by building in a \"clean chroot\" (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot), where a package providing `/sbin/init` is not installed by default. The chroot environment itself does not seem to be relevant though (directly using `nvm` in it is possible) \u2013 it seems like it's only the `makepkg` environment that seems to matter.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, this \"had worked a few weeks ago\" \u2013 but I was not able to find out what had changed on Arch's end that might have caused this.\r\n\r\nI understand this is probably not really an `nvm` issue \u2013 I had just hoped that, with this being an easy fix (without any obvious downsides \u2013 to me at least), which shouldn't do much damage but just handles the non-existing file \"a bit more cleanly\", it might be easiest to address this here. Unless I can find out where things are _actually_ causing the issue in Arch's tools.\r\n",

        "body": "Changed configuration in **nvm_get_download_slug()** function, made condition for **darwin** based OS running on **arm64** arch i.e, **MAC M1**. \r\nIf so, then change HOST_ARCH to **x64** so that NVM will fetch **x64 arch** package from node repository which is the only package node currently having for darwin systems but no arm64 based packages\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n- Macbook M1 ARM64 architecture problem that does not allow us to use default terminal for installing node packages using nvm, please [refer here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2350)\r\n- What we did was use a rosetta-2 terminal for installing different node versions using NVM. It was creating problems for automation developers who use scripts to run operations, and it was not always possible to run the script on a single installed version of the node.\r\n- Even by transforming the current shell to a different arch using rosetta2 e.g, **arch -x86_64 zsh** causing problems as it creates a new instance of the terminal that is indirectly equivalent to using a different terminal i.e, rosetta one, which stops execution of next series of commands if it is invoked inside the script\r\n\r\n#### Solutions Available\r\n- Use the latest version node as old ones were not built for mac m1 arch.\r\n- Use rosetta2 terminal to install node version as it converts architecture from arm64 to amd64, which then nvm install node packages for amd64\r\n- **Solution Provided by me** for automation engineers who don't want to switch on rosetta2 terminal just for installing node versions, Please [refer this](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2350#issuecomment-969947270). Complete consequences explained in detail\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n- Made changes in **nvm.sh** file to update **nvm_get_download_slug()** function that basically gathers architecture information regarding users system. \r\n- Basically **rosetta** was only being used to change architecture so that **nvm_get_download_slug()** would get **x86_64** instead of **arm64** architecture. Because older versions were never designed for **arm64** architectures.\r\n- This part was the pain and I added conditions for the same, so that if the device is apple-based with silicon chip then it will set \"x64\" arch. So that packages fetched from the nodejs repository will be installed properly.\r\n\r\n#### NVM working on mac m1 after making PR changes in nvm.sh\r\n![Problem solved after refreshing changes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77939876/142740986-9201de78-6d44-405d-b393-a7d7dab6df2b.png)\r\n- First I have run \"uname -a\" to show my mac m1 architecture\r\n- Then I am trying to install node 12.22.7 **nvm install 12.22.7** on arm64 arch. This throws me an error as the package was not found.\r\n- Then I sourced the RC file so that my changes in **nvm.sh** reflect in the shell. Whoop, this worked",

More recent versions of shellcheck automatically ignore these instances, but not the older version available on the ubuntu-based github runners. Alternatively, I could ignore the specific lines in nvm.sh rather than globally ignoring SC1001, or I could figure out a way to manually install a more recent version of shellcheck. Let me know!\r\n\r\n",

Since we don't have to actually produce a config, merely detect if any option is set that would influence `npm config get prefix` (namely, `prefix` or `globalconfig`), the checks are simpler and can be done relatively quickly. Previously, #1679, 1458de72934a33b279ac3cbb9d648295501ae74d, 8ee6f3035292b46fe4067a089d2b0752f4ce0e98, and a1def710628a2fc71552a9f79f9b53f3d6a3b8db implemented partial forms of this checking.

It is named *Running \"nvm use node --silent\" doesn't print anything*. It runs ```nvm use node --silent and checks``` and succeeds if the OUTPUT matches the EXPECTED_OUTPUT which is *null*  or *''*. When the test was run locally, it still ouputed results if someone deleted some contents of the *.nvm/* folder. This output was given from the ```nvm deactivate command```. This was the reason that the ```nvm deactivate``` was edited to include silent mode.\r\n\r\n*Note: line numbers may be a bit off due to recent changes*\r\n\r\nFixes #2239",

There are reports of users not sure why their preferred profile file is not being updated here https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2196.\r\n\r\nI suspect that many of these are from people running the given curl command, which currently pipes the install script into bash explicitly, even if the user has zsh or another shell as their default. This will especially bite MacOS Catalina users who now have zsh as their default shell.\r\n\r\nThere is also a way for users to explicitly set which profile file to change by the install script, which some users have asked for not knowing it already exists. Here https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2188, https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/869       . This lets them know how to do that.\r\n\r\nCAVEATS:\r\nI would prefer to use an variable like `$0` instead of `$SHELL` as `$SHELL` does not return the currently used shell, but the default shell. The reason why `$0` can't be used is that it returns the current shell with a `-` in front of it. Once you switch to another shell and then back, the `-` is gone, but its there for all uses before switching to another shell and back. `$SHELL` however is better than the current example which states `bash` explicitly.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be better for the install script to be a smarter about which profile file to change. Right now it is using the existence of `$BASH_VERSION`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `$ZSH_VERSION`, `.zshrc`, and then `.profile`, in that order, to decide. It could instead look at which shell is being used and then set the corresponding profile file, through something like `$SHELL` or `$0`. I'm not versed in shell script so will leave those changes to someone with more experience.",

Probably because I have both .bashrc and .zshrc lying around. \r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\n* I made changes to the install instructions I believe will make it easier to read. \r\n* Added instructions to add the profile snippet manually to the documentation.

It also drops the ` >/dev/null 2>&1` part, because `rm -f` never prints any errors anyway.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I removed the line `unalias nvm_has_system_node` from `test/fast/Listing versions/teardown` because the tests don't create an alias (instead, they redefine the function `nvm_has_system_node`), and it looks like the new definition of `nvm_has_system_node` does not exist anymore after the tests have run (probably because the each test runs in its own process). But I only tested this on my machine by running the tests as scripts. For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/.nvm/test/fast/'Listing versions'\r\n$ ./'Running \"nvm ls\" should include \"system\" when appropriate'\r\n$ type nvm_has_system_node\r\nnvm_has_system_node is a function\r\nnvm_has_system_node () \r\n{ \r\n    [ \"$(nvm deactivate >/dev/null 2>&1 && command -v node)\" != '' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case I missed something and the behavior is different in other shells or in urchin, I'd be happy to add the `unalias` line again.",

The previous behaviour for other operating systems should stay untouched (more testing and feedback are welcome) (and maybe `aix` can also benefit from it, I don't know).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not handles the next issue, which is to compile certain versions of `Node.js` under OpenBSD.

This flag will cause the zsh completion system to ignore files in directories it deems to be insecure. If this flag is not used the user will be prompted to either ignore insecure directories or abort compinit. Ignoring the insecure directories manually is the same as using the -i flag and aborting will cause autocompletion in zsh to fail.
