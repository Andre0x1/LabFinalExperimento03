Here are the pros of using such an alias:\r\n\r\n1. **Simplified Access**: The alias simplifies the process of accessing the shell of a specific Docker container. Instead of typing the full `docker exec` command with the container ID or name, you can use a concise and memorable alias (`dsh`) followed by the container name.\r\n\r\n2. **Increased Productivity**: The alias saves time and keystrokes, which can enhance productivity, especially when you need to access Docker containers frequently. It streamlines the workflow for developers and system administrators.\r\n\r\n3. **Ease of Use**: For users who are not familiar with the intricacies of Docker commands, having an easy-to-use alias abstracts away the complexity. This makes it more accessible to team members who might not be Docker experts.\r\n\r\n4. **Consistency**: By using a standardized alias across team members and projects, you establish consistency in your workflow. Everyone can use the same alias, ensuring that the process of accessing Docker containers remains uniform.\r\n\r\n5. **Reduced Typographical Errors**: The alias reduces the chance of typographical errors when executing `docker exec` commands manually. This is especially helpful when dealing with long container IDs or complex container names.\r\n\r\n6. **Scripting and Automation**: If you have scripts that need to interact with Docker containers, using an alias in your scripts simplifies the code and makes it more readable. This can lead to cleaner, more maintainable automation scripts.\r\n\r\n7. **Learning and Teaching**: For educational purposes, having a simplified alias can aid in teaching Docker concepts. It allows learners to focus on the core ideas without getting bogged down by the specific syntax of Docker commands.\r\n\r\n8. **Customization**: The alias can be easily modified or extended to include additional functionality, such as running specific commands within the container context. This flexibility allows users to tailor the alias to their specific needs.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the `dsh()` alias provides a more user-friendly and efficient way to interact with Docker containers, offering simplicity, consistency, and productivity benefits for both individual developers and teams working with Dockerized applications.\r\n",

This solution attempts to consider most standard linux OSes with the use of /etc/os-release and $OSTYPE.

It\u2019s unlikely *many* users will be doing genome analyses, but perhaps the existence in a major package manager is enough reason to avoid the alias?\r\n\r\n2. `gta` for `git tag --annotate` (suggested in #10854).\r\n\r\n   This makes an \u201cannotated tag\u201d, the modern tag format that includes a message, the author details, and timestamp. Annotated tags should nearly always be used, so we can help this with an alias.\r\n\r\n   It\u2019s also a bit weird we already have `gts` for `git tag --sign`, which is an extended form of annotated tag with GPG-signing. I would think GPG-signing is much less common than unsigned tags.\r\n  \r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nCloses #10747 \r\nCloses #10854 \r\n",

(Representation can be added by setting up a textconv filter.)\r\n\r\nSecond, with `--text`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git stash show --text\r\ndiff --git donut.png donut.png\r\nnew file mode 100644\r\nindex 0000000..be8dd81\r\n--- /dev/null\r\n+++ donut.png\r\n@@ -0,0 +1,938 @@\r\n+<89>PNG^M\r\n+^Z\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output continues with the remainder of the PNG's bytes. This is never useful behaviour since even if you could read the binary data, it isn't well displayed. On some terminal setups, random bytes can break rendering.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nThe `--text` option was included with the creation of the alias, way back in #1864, without any discussion.\r\n",

Like `--hard`, it moves the current branch to point to a named commit, but it does not throw away uncommitted changes. I would say this is generally a better idea as uncommitted changes are precious\u2014Git provides no way to retrieve them, since Git tracks files *within* commits.\r\n\r\n`--keep` is not well known, perhaps due to the obtuse description [in the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#Documentation/git-reset.txt---keep). I\u2019m trying to change that and promote it.\r\n\r\n### 2. `grhs` = `git reset --soft`\r\n\r\n`--soft` undoes commits, and preserves their changes. It\u2019s similar to the default mode, `--mixed`, but keeps the changes staged:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git reset --soft @~\r\n\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch commentary\r\nChanges to be committed:\r\n    modified:   hamlet.txt\r\n    modified:   macbeth.txt\r\n\r\nChanges not staged for commit:\r\n    modified:   othello.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means you can tweak the changes before committing them again. With the default mode, you have to re-add changes before making another commit.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nCloses #9398 \r\n",

This avoids lines being wide except where needed. It also makes it easier to edit the table without introducing broken alignment, like I did before as fixed in #11878.\r\n3. Fix the display of some aliases. For example, `gbgd` and `gbgD` weren't showing the whole aliased command due to unescaped `|` characters (interpreted by Markdown as a column marker).\r\n4.

When no commit range is specified, that means the initial commit.\r\n\r\nFor example, in one of my projects, I created the `.editorconfig` file in the initial commit. A vanilla `git blame` on that file shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git blame .editorconfig\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  1) # http://editorconfig.org\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  2)\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  3) root = true\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  4)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`d7a14a1` is the abbreviated SHA for the initial commit in the project, and the `^` prefix indicates it as the boundary commit.\r\n\r\nAdding `-b` changes the output to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git blame -b .editorconfig | cat\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  1) # http://editorconfig.org\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  2)\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  3) root = true\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe commit SHA is gone for all lines untouched since the initial commit, although the author name and date remain.\r\n\r\nIMO, this is confusing to those who haven\u2019t got deep knowledge of `git blame`.\r\n\r\noh-my-zsh added `-b` with the `gbl` alias in #2790, copied out of #2433, without discussion of the options. I propose removing it. Advanced Git users can enable the behaviour globally if they like with the [`blame.blankBoundary` option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt-blameblankBoundary):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit config --global blame.blankBoundary true\r\n```",

Example: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR title is descriptive.\r\n- [x] The PR doesn't replicate another PR that is already open.\r\n- [x] I have read the contribution guide and followed all the instructions.\r\n- [x] The code follows the code style guide detailed in the wiki.\r\n- [x] The code is mine or it's from somewhere with an MIT-compatible license.\r\n- [x] The code is efficient, to the best of my ability, and does not waste computer resources.\r\n- [x] The code is stable and I have tested it myself, to the best of my abilities.\r\n- [x] If the code introduces new aliases, I provide a valid use case for all plugin users down below.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n\r\n> Before starting, I want to clarify the norms I will use.\r\n> On `alias a=abc`, 'abc' is the source of the alias, and 'a' is the destination of the alias.\r\n> If this naming seems inappropriate, please let me know. I couldn't find better names... \r\n> (This is important because the same namings are also written in [readme](https://github.com/roeniss/ohmyzsh/commit/6eb647d5a5b9f8dad3c5ab5b8d8060c65af546a5#diff-7a6e14abfc821561312a2d3217f3d66c89bb4237460daa7fb0c03ceaaffe84a6R17)) \r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. --cheaper/-c\r\n\r\n- Add `--cheaper/-c` option: Shows only the aliases where the destination is shorter than the current input (command). This option could filter out the following example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n> alias g=git\r\n> alias longerCmd=git\r\n> alias-finder -c git\r\ng=git\r\n# longerCmd would be filtered out\r\n>\r\n```\r\n- You might wonder how such an odd alias could exist: When I made an issue I had a very specific plausible case but now I forgot. I'm sorry about such a poor example above.\r\n- At the beginning, I tried with `shorter`, but it doesn't make sense with names on existing options (longer, exact) because those are about the source of aliases, and my new option is about the destination of aliases. You can see a more detailed explanation (not much different) on [readme](https://github.com/roeniss/ohmyzsh/commit/6eb647d5a5b9f8dad3c5ab5b8d8060c65af546a5#diff-7a6e14abfc821561312a2d3217f3d66c89bb4237460daa7fb0c03ceaaffe84a6R19-R21)\r\n\r\n### 2. Reformat codes\r\n\r\nThe original codebase was pretty efficient but hard to follow (maybe because of my lack of competency). So I add some comments, refactor the codebase, and flatten the flow.\r\n\r\n### 3. Support zstyle\r\n\r\nAs suggested in [the original issue](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/11624#issuecomment-1517966744), I added some zstyle options but still support previous env variable option for backward compatibility (also added TODO comments for them). Because the env variable is not preferable, I removed the relevant section from readme. \r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nI tried `zunit` test framework and it was quite helpful. But none of the plugins seems not having testcode like that Should I remove it from this pr?\r\n\r\nOne last thing: I haven't made pr for a change like this for any open source before. So if I was wrong somewhere, please give me some advice on that. :D",

Solution based on: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/2041#issuecomment-990253001\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\nWhen you add the Pyenv plugin to the `~/.zshrc` file and restart the terminal, you can get a message about pyenv being badlye configured. Even after following all the suggested advice, it can often still appear. This is due to the installation instructions being unclear, and often simply appending the needed commands to the end of the `~/.zshrc` file. However, this can be cleared up by running the necessary commands AFTER the plugin is initialized.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of this requirement anywhere outside of that one comment thread, and adding a simple suggestion would go a long way to helping new installs. I would prefer that the requirement for it being before the plugins are initialized not be a requirement, but I would not know how to make that fix.\r\n",

This is needed because normally autoload needs to load nvm to find the nvmrc, so it won't work with lazy.  This allows it to detect an nvmrc in the *current directory only*, to lazily load nvm automatically.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nI'm submitting this as a draft for now mostly just to see if anyone else thinks it's a good idea.  It works very well for my workflow.  My terminals that need a rich prompt and nvm pretty much always open in a directory with an nvmrc.  But it might be confusing for others?  It was motivated initially by the fact that the readme doesn't specify that the two options are mutually exclusive, so I expected them to work together.  But this was throwing errors so I wanted to 'fix' it.  This is how I did it for myself.  If this isn't a good distributable solution, I'll probably do a second PR just to make it more clear in the readme that you have to pick one of those settings (and maybe print a warning or something if they're both turned on anyways?)\r\n",

So this change ensures OSC 1 + OSC 2 logic is used, to streamline this change with most TEs.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nI personally think that the host programmable statusline is a bad start to simply show that string is probably not the best choice to begin with.

If the terminal doesn't support this, it isn't feasible to add links as they'd be fully visible in the terminal output.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I suspect you'll have an opinion about the suitability of this PR. I'll be happy to amend it as required, especially if you have anything else you'd like in that conditional statement.\r\n\r\nFixes #11545",

Since the `exps` list is unordered with respect to the 3rd element (i.e., they key for the group), this results in chunking together of items with the same key only if it is fortunate enough to be immediately before or immediately after another expression with the same key. Without sorting the list of `exps`, numerous expressions get put into a bin of one when they should be included in a larger group, which results in erroneously putting these expressions into the \"_default\" group.\r\n- Aliases that previously showed up in the \"_default\" group when invoking `acs`, even though other aliases existed with the same base command, are now categorized correctly. The \"_default\" group now only shows aliases that truly do not share a base command with other aliases.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nAs an example, enable the `web_search` plugin and notice that before this change, the command `acs web_search` results in the following:\r\n```\r\n[_default]\r\n\tbing = web_search bing\r\n\tbrs = web_search brave\r\n\tddg = web_search duckduckgo\r\n\tducky = web_search duckduckgo \\!\r\n\tecosia = web_search ecosia\r\n\timage = web_search duckduckgo \\!i\r\n\tmap = web_search duckduckgo \\!m\r\n\tnews = web_search duckduckgo \\!n\r\n\tqwant = web_search qwant\r\n\tscholar = web_search scholar\r\n\r\n[web_search]\r\n\tarchive = web_search archive\r\n\task = web_search ask\r\n\tbaidu = web_search baidu\r\n\tgithub = web_search github\r\n\tgivero = web_search givero\r\n\tgoodreads = web_search goodreads\r\n\tgoogle = web_search google\r\n\tsp = web_search startpage\r\n\tstackoverflow = web_search stackoverflow\r\n\twiki = web_search duckduckgo \\!w\r\n\twolframalpha = web_search wolframalpha\r\n\tyahoo = web_search yahoo\r\n\tyandex = web_search yandex\r\n\tyoutube = web_search duckduckgo \\!yt\r\n```\r\nAnd after the change in this commit, `acs web_search` yields the correct result:\r\n```\r\n[web_search]\r\n\tarchive = web_search archive\r\n\task = web_search ask\r\n\tbaidu = web_search baidu\r\n\tbing = web_search bing\r\n\tbrs = web_search brave\r\n\tddg = web_search duckduckgo\r\n\tducky = web_search duckduckgo \\!\r\n\tecosia = web_search ecosia\r\n\tgithub = web_search github\r\n\tgivero = web_search givero\r\n\tgoodreads = web_search goodreads\r\n\tgoogle = web_search google\r\n\timage = web_search duckduckgo \\!i\r\n\tmap = web_search duckduckgo \\!m\r\n\tnews = web_search duckduckgo \\!n\r\n\tqwant = web_search qwant\r\n\tscholar = web_search scholar\r\n\tsp = web_search startpage\r\n\tstackoverflow = web_search stackoverflow\r\n\twiki = web_search duckduckgo \\!w\r\n\twolframalpha = web_search wolframalpha\r\n\tyahoo = web_search yahoo\r\n\tyandex = web_search yandex\r\n\tyoutube = web_search duckduckgo \\!yt\r\n```\r\n",

From my personal perspective, the project in question is [LLVM](http://github.com/llvm/llvm-project). In my local fork, I go wild with branches and merge commits, but the official upstream does **not** use pull requests and mandates a strict linear history, so there is often the need to squash and rebase my local contents against the upstream cleanly often before creating patches. As such, I expect these commands to be generally useful for project of similar size and rules, such as [Linux](http://github.com/torvalds/linux).\r\n\r\nTwo of the aliases in question just duplicate existing ones but embed the conventional `upstream` repository name instead of `origin`. Other aliases where `upstream` is used are already in the codebase of the plugin.\r\n\r\nI've been having [`git ffmerge`, here proposed as `gmff`](https://github.com/whisperity/dotfiles/commit/dd2b31f42ad7becf2bfd7c753158c7704a35fa2b#diff-3cbe50069f7ffe4d55b4d1fe7a72fb79e9c9545af55d8326a728b98f00481bf2R41) as an alias for close to a decade now (the versioning of the Dotfiles was not happening when I already had some of the personal aliases, long before I knew Zsh even existed!) and I can track down [`git rbum`, here proposed as `grbum`](https://github.com/whisperity/dotfiles/commit/fb99a984abfd5d9e89369e2ad761165963c7bed9#diff-10b8a5fda4d7bc4e07047f39c757c2cee2951366f030179d680c74866b1d096dR72) to roundabout 4.5 years ago, when I started doing major contributions to upstream LLVM as opposed to working on an in-house downstream derivative.",

This is often useful as cmake directories are often large and this allows users to quickly open the main file.

This allows users to make sense of their project. \r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\nSix other commands have also been added in the form of functions to automatically create cmake config files and run cmake commands. There is also a txt file which acts as a template for the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file. More details can be found in the readme of the plugin.\r\n",

Notable expceptions to this are:\r\n\r\n- All standard reports receive a set of three additional aliases to easily filter tasks that are due in the day, week and month.\r\n- Since Taskwarrior version 2.6, the user has the option to \"purge\" tasks instead of deleting them. This allows users to completely wipe out unwanted data from their program. However, in order to purge a task, one must get its UUID. I have made an alias to easily use the UUIDs of _all_ deleted tasks as the input to the command.\r\n\r\nDuplicate aliases that conflict with other plugins are highlighted with comments, please instruct wether they should be renamed or not.\r\n\r\nI do not know why the other PR was closed, the thread ended without a clear explanation. Should this implementation not be of the developers' interest, please let me know.",
