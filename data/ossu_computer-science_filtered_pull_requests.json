        "body": "I see that there is a thread containing discussion on the inclusion of cybersecurity resources #639. That repository has remained quiet for some time, but the field is continuing to grow in importance at a seemingly exceptional rate. I therefore think it should be an option to engage in a security related specialisation at the end of the OSSU.\r\n\r\nSee the specialisation home page here: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-cybersecurity-analyst\r\n\r\n**Overview**\r\n- The specialisation is comprised of 8 courses, with a capstone and assessment at the end, much like the other specialisations listed in the 'Final Project' section.\r\n- High quality teachers and recognised cybersecurity giant backing.\r\n- Wide range of of areas covered including an introduction, operational security, sysadmin, networking, threat assessment, database security and incident response. \r\n- Highly rated curriculum (4.5 stars minimum course rating - capstone project rated at 4.8 stars). Ratings are a representation of over 60,000 students enrolled on the course (with approximately 5700 ratings). \r\n- Course material is up to date.\r\n- The recommended completion time is in keeping with the other courses in this section.\r\n- English, Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, Spanish subtitles.\r\n- The course is available to enrol for free.\r\n- The course is appropriately challenging and in keeping with the other courses in this section. The course starts out with a 'beginner' rated introduction and progresses to 'intermediate' difficulty by the end.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**\r\n- There are some complaints about the audio quality on the videos. I would say that, although it is not perfect quality, it is perfectly audible and not at all difficult to understand or grating to listen to. In any case, the content of the video lectures is thorough and I personally feel that the course is taught in a clear, concise and easy to understand way.\r\n- Adding a cybersecurity related course to the Final Projects section may not be appropriate since the other cybersecurity sections of the readme note that their inclusion is provisional pending further consideration. Notwithstanding, it is clear that more and more traditional brick and mortar universities are putting a greater and greater emphasis on cybersecurity in their curriculum's and it would be prudent to mirror that behaviour.\r\n- Since the courses are taught by IBM, there is naturally discussion of some of the tools IBM offers, though this does not detract from the quality delivery of the subject matter and how best to approach various cybersecurity challanges. Traditional open source cybersecurity tools are heavily utilised.\r\n\r\n**Sundaries**\r\n- If accepted, the course will need adding to the Trello board.\r\n\r\nThe OSSU is a fantastic resource and I am very grateful to have been able to take advantage of it. I believe it can only get better by embracing cybersecurity resources and adding them as a path for future students to take.  For many people the OSSU is their only option for getting a high quality, structured education in computer science and I think they should be given the option to engage deeper with cybersecurity.\r\n\r\n^ The above said, I am no cybersecurity vetran and would certainly welcome the thoughts of those who are on IBM's offering. I have considered the contribution guidelines and this repository and hope that I have not missed anything obvious as to why this cannot be included. ",

I like @bradleygrant 's ideas of brevity, usability etc. but OSTEP is a whole other monster. I was not able to follow the guidelines there all that much.\r\n\r\nI decided on some folder structure, trying to be similar to `extras`, like `coursepages/coresystems/OSTEP` so other folders/pages can be added similarly later.\r\n\r\nI added some hints to tough projects. In fact the `vm` project is straight up un-doable as it is, because the `xv6` source code already implements it. So I added a zip file for a different source code.\r\n\r\nThis would obviously be the most complicated course page we'll ever have, so it can give an idea to contributors on how to tackle some of the other courses.

There has been recent discussion indicating that an 8-month introductory course may be too ambitious for the OSSU program (including on the Discord channel and #785.) Meanwhile, many students on the Discord report being able to complete Py4E in substantially shorter time periods by increasing the amount of effort.\r\n\r\nThe 34 week course duration is estimated from an assumed 3 hours of effort per week. Other courses in the OSSU program assume 8-12 hours of effort per week. \r\n\r\n**Problem:** Assigning 3 hours of effort per week for our Py4E course is artificially inflating the perceived length of the course.\r\n\r\n**Complication:** The course is truly self-paced, and progress can be made with as little as 3 hours of effort per week - should the student so choose.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:** Adjust the advertised level of effort to a nominal 10 weeks at a nominal 10 hours of effort per week, to put this course on parity with the introductory courses that follow it. Provide additional notation to clarify that the course is self-paced and the required level of effort can be adjusted to meet the student's needs.",

        "body": "I just 'finished' the course. I've taken 14 or so OSSU classes and found this very helpful and wish I'd taken it earlier (especially the Vim chapter). The class is laid out and meant to be completed in 11 class days and 18 calendar days. I half-heartedly tried to keep up with their schedule (videos and exercises), and found it somewhat impractical. The videos take 45 mins - 1 hour, and the exercises vary in number and time required. Roughly 2 - 10 exercises some taking 5 minutes while other could take 2+ hours. I often found I didn't have the programs installed, or that the exercise required me to do a bit of research to learn the tool. I'm on a Mac, and Linux might have more of these tools installed by default, but that's not something we can expect from students. Also, these are problems I'm running into after being an OSSU student for about 2 years. I wouldn't expect somebody just starting off working with computers / learning CS to be comfortable doing CLI stuff, and thus would likely take longer than me to do a lot of these tasks.\r\n\r\nTwo options: \r\n - Increase the duration / effort from 2 weeks at 12hrs/week to 3 weeks at 15+hrs/week (but tbh, the time required is unbounded if you complete all exercises because of OS/system problems possible with some tools)\r\n - Include my description in this pull request (or similar wording). I think this option sticks with what this class was set out to be - an introduction and a resource, but not an end in itself\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "I propose using Georgia Tech's CS1301 (Computing In Python) course as an alternate introduction course, either in lieu of MITx 6.00.1x, or sequenced before 6.00.1x.\r\n\r\nGeorgia Tech's CS1301x course is an adaptation of a 16-week on-campus course which first became available on EdX in July 2018, and is offered as a four-part sequence leading to an optional Professional Certificate. Completing this course provides an equivalent background to MIT's 6.00.1x course, but provides more instruction and extensive practice in Python coding, with over 300 short coding problems to help build confidence and muscle memory in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThis course also provides access to a free \"adaptive textbook\" which tests one's understanding of the material. A non-adaptive PDF copy is made available for offline reading.\r\n\r\nHaving taken both courses, in my opinion MITx 6.00.1x provides an excellent introduction to computer science concepts but expects the user to pick up Python more or less on his own. GTx CS1301 serves as a gentler introduction, teaching the same concepts but also taking time to teach Python along the way. This may be a more attractive option for true beginners, many of which find 6.00.1x to be too much all at once.",

        "body": "The stated purpose of the Intro CS section is \"for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them.\"\r\n\r\nBut currently, the first step to \"try out CS\" is to take a 12 week course. That's a big time investment just to try something out.\r\n\r\nSo I added a super-short \"crash course\" (3 readings) that gives folks a taste for what it feels like to think like a computer scientist. It's called The Intuitive Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, hosted on interviewcake.com.\r\n\r\nOpen to moving this to the extras section instead, as the contributor guidelines seem to suggest. But IMO there's some real strength to opening the main curriculum with something \"bite-size\" like this, to get students hooked who otherwise would have just bounced.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: my team wrote The Intuitive Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms :)",

With OSS and self-motivated stuff it's always good to have ways to build momentum and keep you motivated ... I designed this guide specifically to help kick-start people into doing an OSS course, with the preferred course being Prof. Andrew Ng's course, which you already recommend.\n\nLooking forward to hearing what you think.\n\nThank you for this invaluable resource! As someone reared on OSS and self-taught material ... it's wonderful to find something so complete, that I can relay to interested friends.\n",
