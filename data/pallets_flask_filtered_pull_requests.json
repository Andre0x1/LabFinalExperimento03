        "body": "Description:\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a new feature, the \"Flask Startup Library,\" designed to simplify the setup and initialization of Flask projects. It streamlines the process of creating Flask projects with virtual environments, static and template folders, essential templates, and more, enhancing the Flask development experience for users.\r\n\r\n**Changes Introduced:**\r\n\r\n- Added the `startup-flask-app` library to the Flask project structure, which can be used for initializing new Flask projects.\r\n- The library offers options to remove spaces, add hyphens, or join words when naming a project directory.\r\n- Allows users to create a virtual environment with a single command.\r\n- Creates a directory structure for the project, including static and templates folders with essential HTML templates.\r\n- Sets up basic configurations in `app.py`, `models.py`, `forms.py`, and more.\r\n- Provides a \"packages.py\" file to activate the virtual environment, install project dependencies, and run the Flask application.\r\n\r\n**Use Case:**\r\n\r\nThis feature is designed to benefit both beginners and experienced Flask developers by reducing the manual effort required to set up a new Flask project. Users can quickly initialize a project with a standardized structure, helping them get started on their Flask applications more efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Usage:**\r\n\r\nUsers can incorporate this feature into their Flask projects by including the `startup-flask-app` library and using it to simplify project setup. It provides a smoother onboarding experience for Flask developers.\r\n\r\n**Contributor's Note:**\r\n\r\nI have taken care to follow Flask's coding standards, adhere to its licensing terms, and provide documentation for this feature. Thorough testing has also been conducted to ensure its reliability.\r\n\r\nPlease review this feature and consider it for inclusion in the Flask project. If any adjustments or additional information are required, please don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nThis feature aims to enhance the Flask development experience and make Flask more accessible to developers of all levels. Thank you for your consideration.",

I've rewritten the docs from scratch to try to focus on the topics that matter for understanding Celery's model and how it fits with Flask. I've also added a full example showing how to use Celery and run tasks with JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIn particular, use `@shared_task` instead of `@celery.task`. This way, tasks objects are created for the _current_ Flask app. A Celery app is associated with the Flask app and configured from it each time the factory is called. This relies on Celery's \"default app\" concept.\r\n\r\nBased on what I figured out for these docs, I think it would be able to take this further and create a Flask extension that manages it for us and doesn't require `shared_task` or the default app, but that's outside the scope of these docs.\r\n\r\ncloses #4837 ",

I think it would be good to note that these error messages should be generic as detailed by the OWASP project and considered best practice from a security point of view. \r\n\r\n### What has been done\r\nAs the Flask tutorial explicitly returns messages that might reveal useful information to potential attackers, a section was added to raise awareness that in a real world application the reader might want to use more generic error messages as advised by the OWASP project (a link to the documentation of OWASP is provided).\r\n\r\n",

Here is an example of the permissions in one of the workflow runs:\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/actions/runs/3166686271/jobs/5156565079#step:1:19\n\nAfter this change, the scopes will be reduced to the minimum needed for the following workflows:\n\n- lock.yaml\n- tests.yaml\n\n\n### Motivation and Context\n\n- This is a security best practice, so if the GITHUB_TOKEN is compromised due to a vulnerability or compromised Action, the damage will be reduced.\n- [GitHub recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token) defining minimum GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.\n- The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) also treats not setting token permissions as a high-risk issue. This change will help increase the Scorecard score for this repository.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ashish Kurmi <akurmi@stepsecurity.io>",

        "body": "This adds the ability to fully customize the JSON implementation used by a Flask application. Using a different JSON implementation can greatly speed up API applications that need to work with JSON in most requests.\r\n\r\n`app.json` is an instance of `Flask.json_provider_class`. `flask.json.provider.JSONProvider` is the base class that defines `dumps`, `dump`, `loads`, `load`, and `response` methods, of which only `dumps` and `loads` need to be implemented.  For example, here's a provider for [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask.json.provider import JSONProvider\r\nimport orjson\r\n\r\nclass OrJSONProvider(JSONProvider):\r\n    def dumps(self, obj, *, option=None, **kwargs):\r\n        if option is None:\r\n            option = orjson.OPT_APPEND_NEWLINE | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC\r\n        \r\n        return orjson.dumps(obj, option=option).decode()\r\n\r\n    def loads(self, s, **kwargs):\r\n        return orjson.loads(s)\r\n\r\n# assign to an app instance\r\napp.json = OrJSONProvider(app)\r\n\r\n# or assign in a subclass\r\nclass MyFlask(Flask):\r\n    json_provider_class = OrJSONProvider\r\n\r\napp = MyFlask(__name__)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe methods in `flask.json` call the methods on `app.json` if an app context is active, or fall back to the `json` library. `jsonify` calls `app.json.response`. The `|tojson` filter uses `app.json.dumps`. `Request.json` uses `app.json.loads` and `Response.json` uses `app.json.dumps`; the test client uses these as well.\r\n\r\nCustomizing `json_encoder` or `json_decoder` on an app or blueprint, and the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes, are deprecated. This was not an effective way to use other libraries. Customizing per blueprint was requested by an API extension that is no longer maintained and didn't appear to use the feature. It's not clear how it would work with the new provider interface and added overhead to every request. Instead, API frameworks should be using a dedicated object serialization library, then taking advantage of a fast JSON serializer at the application level.\r\n\r\nThe `DefaultJSONProvider` is the existing implementation using the built-in `json` library. The `app.config` keys `JSON_AS_ASCII`, `JSON_SORT_KEYS`, `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`, and `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` are deprecated and have moved to attributes on the default provider. Other providers are not required to support these options.",

        "body": "While investigating `ContextVar` in https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/pull/2436, I realized that there's no reason to use a `LocalStack` now to manage `RequestContext` and `AppContext`.\r\n\r\n`LocalStack` incurs some performance and memory overhead on every `push` and `pop` because it uses a mutable list as the value of the `ContextVar`. Since we can never know if this context was copied by `asyncio` or asgiref into a child context, we always have to copy the list before mutating it, then set it again, otherwise mutations would be unsafe.\r\n\r\n`RequestContext` and `AppContext` already have their own internal thread-unsafe state to track how many times they've been pushed, and implicit app contexts for request contexts.\r\n\r\nNow, the contexts keep an internal stack of `contextvars.Token` objects, appending a new token when pushed. This allows resetting the context var to the previous value when the context is popped. Essentially, this makes the contexts singly-linked lists instead of stacks.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that `_app_ctx_stack.top` and `_request_ctx_stack.top` will no longer exist. Currently, there is a fake object that keeps the API around, since it's used by extensions to store state. However, importing them or accessing them will show deprecation warnings. Docs now encourage using `g` instead of the internal contexts for extension state. I added `app_ctx` and `request_ctx` objects that are proxies to the current objects, in case existing extensions want a less drastic change.\r\n\r\nThis bumps the minimum version of Werkzeug to 2.2 (currently 2.2.0a1) to take advantage of changes to its implementation of `LocalProxy`.",

Maybe we can rethink about this feature? I propose this because the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- List as JSON response is a common use case for Web APIs. We support returning dict as JSON, but not list. This makes people feel inconsistent (#4533, #4659).\r\n- With #2737, we only treat tuple as a valid shortcut for return values, so there will be no program conflicts to allow returning list (we also throw an error for list return value currently).\r\n- In terms of semantics, there is no concept of \"tuple\" in JSON. Although list and tuple are both sequences in Python, there are differences in syntax and meaning. We can add docs to address the different meaning of list and tuple in return values.\r\n- In terms of visuals, most people will not mix `[1, 2, 3]` and `(1, 2, 3)`, and people usually return tuple items without the bracket in the view function.\r\n\r\nIf this change is acceptable, I will update the docs and changelog.\r\n\r\nSorry for break the \"zero status\". :P\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change.

If the `werkzeug.debug.preserve_context` key is in the environ, it is a callable. It is called to record context managers that should be entered again after the request ends. Rather than keeping the contexts on the stack for longer, this allows preserving the contexts independently of the context-local stack and subsequent requests.\r\n\r\nBecause `request`, `g`, etc. are context-local, they would never be available in the debugger when using the default threaded server. Now they will point to the correct data in the debugger. The same mechanism is used by the test client.\r\n\r\nThe contexts are now always popped at the end of the request, even if they are preserved. This means teardown functions will run to clean up resources. The previous implementation would pop the preserved context from the stack on the next, but that would never happen when using the threaded server because each request would be in a new thread with its own stack. I have a feeling this was causing issues especially with Flask-SQLAlchemy, where connections would never be released for requests caught by the debugger.\r\n\r\nThe contexts are restored after the request finishes in the test client, or when code is executed in the debugger. This means that signals will run each time, and teardown functions will run each time.\r\n\r\nOnly the contexts directly preserved by `werkzeug.debug.preserve_context` are popped. This reverts #3157, which caused every instance of the same context to be popped. This means that the context preserved with `stream_with_context` will not be popped when a `with client` block ends, it will only be popped once `response.data` is read (or `response.close()` is called).\r\n\r\ncloses #2836",

This means that any callbacks under a group decorated with `@with_appcontext` will also have access to the same app context.\r\n\r\n`@AppGroup.command` and `group` still have the `with_appcontext=True` keyword argument, since it's possible to register commands directly with `FlaskGroup.command`, or to register commands with other CLIs that might not push the context automatically like `FlaskGroup` does.\r\n\r\nfixes #2410",

Did not add an option for `FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV` since it's only useful when being called from another CLI that already manages env vars and can set it already.\r\n* `-A, --app`\r\n* `-E, --env` works by setting the `FLASK_ENV` env var internally, as this is still the only way it can be available early enough during `Flask.__init__` and factory functions without making it an argument to `__init__`.\r\n* `--debug/--no-debug` only sets `app.debug` if it's actually provided on the command line, and works like `--env` by setting the `FLASK_DEBUG` env var. It is still skipped for now if `ScriptInfo.set_debug_flag` is `False` because I couldn't think of a good way to do that.\r\n\r\nThis did require some tricks to get custom commands to work. The app needs to be loaded as early as possible, otherwise `--help` and `no_args_is_help` won't see it in time to list the commands.

Both these options are `is_eager=True`, and also get processed before `parse_args` runs in case they were only given as env vars.\r\n\r\nAll docs are rewritten to use the CLI options instead of environment variables in most cases.

However, one of `g.user['id']` and `post['author_id']` was a string and the other was an integer. This caused the equality comparison to fail in every case.\r\n\r\nNow, a Jinja filter is used to cast each of the operands to the same type prior to the equality comparison being evaluated. \r\n\r\nThis ensures that the \"Edit\" link/button now shows up when appropriate.\r\n\r\n- fixes #4587 \r\n\r\nThis PR only touches the docs, so removing the checklist as indicated by the comment.\r\n",

The message about not preserving the request method and body is not relevant for the modern status code. Also edited the message a bit, although it shouldn't be seen anymore.\r\n* When `files` raises a `DebugFilesKeyError`, it looks like the original error rather than a chained exception.\r\n* `on_json_loading_failed` tries to return the `super()` implementation first, then reraises any error in debug mode.\r\n\r\nI originally started working on this due to https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/pull/2355, because I thought it might be better to not suppress JSON errors outside debug mode. 400 errors indicate a problem with client data, so it seems ok to show what that problem was.

        "body": "The `errorhandler` decorator should decorate a callable that takes a `BaseException` argument. However, it doesn't appear possible to type this correctly while accounting for different ways that the decorator is used.\r\n\r\n#4095 reported that it wasn't possible to type the function argument to match the decorator argument, and fixed it by using a `contravariant` `TypeVar` to represent a generic `Exception`. #4295 reported that the fix broke for some cases that did match, and fixed it by removing the `Protocol` in favor of a basic `Callable` type. However, neither of these could actually ensure that the exception used in the decorator was the same used in the argument type.\r\n\r\n#4297 reported that it wasn't possible to decorate a function multiple times to handle different exceptions. Going back to `BaseException` instead of `GenericException` fixed that, but broke the other two issues again. And it still wasn't possible to type correctly, since the argument was actually a union, not a single exception.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, I made the callable take `Any` instead. At the expense of not actually ensuring that the user gave the argument an `Exception` type, it allows them to decorate multiple times and to use a specific type or union of types on the function argument.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that mypy's output of `ResponseValue` said `Any` instead of `AnyStr`, so I replaced it with `str, bytes`. It would be nice if this output was configurable, since `ResponseValue` is so complex it makes it unreadable.",

Besides, we add temporary fix for Windows caching <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/332\">issue</a>, that the <code>pip cache dir</code> command returns non zero exit code or writes to stderr. Moreover we updated <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/327\">node-fetch dependency</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update\u00a0actions/cache\u00a0version to 1.0.8</h2>\n<p>We have updated\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md#108\">actions/cache</a>\u00a0dependency version to 1.0.8 to support 10GB cache upload</p>\n<h2>Support caching dependencies</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/266\">actions/setup-python#266</a>)</p>\n<h2>Caching dependencies.</h2>\n<p>The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring pip/pipenv dependencies. The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.</p>\n<p>Besides, this release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure.</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (requirements.txt for pip or Pipfile.lock for pipenv) in the whole repository. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when you want to override current behaviour and use different file for hash generation (for example requirements-dev.txt). This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Caching pip dependencies:</h3>\n<pre><code>steps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n  with:\n    python-version: '3.9'\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
