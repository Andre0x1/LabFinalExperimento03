I feel I can write the distributed deep learning models just like how I write the model on my laptop.  Most importantly, it can greatly save my training time.

I have also added various evolutionary algorithms materials on python language.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n- Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance and is recently widely used in various scientific computing programs as their major language. \r\n- Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.\r\n- Julia is dynamically typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.\r\n- Julia has a rich language of descriptive datatypes, and type declarations can be used to clarify and solidify programs.\r\n- Julia has high-level syntax, making it an accessible language for programmers from any background or experience level. \r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe links of the videos and text has been checked by me.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Content Update (change which fixes an issue or updates an already existing submission)\r\n- [x] New Article (change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation change\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** document.\r\n- [x] I have made checks to ensure URLs and other resources are valid\r\n",

At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn\u2019t really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub, and quite frankly, I learned a lot more than I would have doing anything else. I believe that the best way to learn is to create. Try, fail, and get back up again. Make something cool even if you don't 100% know what you are doing. Then, try and make it even better. Trust me, you\u2019ll amaze yourself with what you'll build. \r\n",
