Hope to see our free tier put to good use! \r\n\r\nCheers from Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 \r\n\r\n## Why we built deco.cx\r\n\r\nWe were frustrated about how hard it is to deploy a modern TS + Tailwind website with a proper visual editor/admin UI for business users. **So many choices to make!** Which framework? Which platform to deploy on? Which headless CMS? Which A/B testing tool? Which monitoring service? How do we wire all of that together? Oh no, there goes the budget again...\r\n\r\nThat's why we built deco.cx: so that anyone with basic TypeScript and CSS can deploy a fully-functional, enterprise-grade storefront connected to any API as a data source within a few minutes, AND get PageSpeed 90+. \r\n\r\nWe're an edge-native frontend platform focused on making ecommerce websites fast. You write TSX + Tailwind, we generate a beautiful visual CMS automatically. We render your app at the edge, which allows for fast *and* personalized sites at scale, so you can use our built-in A/B testing and content segmentation without fear. Built by devs with 10+ years experience scaling global enterprise ecommerce web properties. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n * [x] This is Software as a Service not self hosted\r\n * [x] It has a free tier not just a free trial\r\n * [x] Pricing information is clearly visible without signup or phone calls\r\n * [x] The submission mentions what is free\r\n * [x] The submission is not already present in the list\r\n * [x] The service has contact details of those running it and a privacy policy\r\n",

        "body": "https://staticman.net/docs/getting-started.html\r\nyou need to deploy it yourself using heroku/docker and I didnt see any public instances\r\n```\r\nStep 2. Deploy Staticman\r\nRead through the [Staticman API config values](https://staticman.net/docs/api) and note the config values you wish to use. At a minimum, you must include a way for Staticman to auth with a git provider, as well as an RSA private key. To generate the RSA private key you can use\r\n\r\nopenssl genrsa\r\nIf you need the newline literals (for example when using JSON configs since multiline strings are not permitted) you can use\r\n\r\nopenssl genrsa | sed '$!s/$/\\\\n/' | tr -d '\\n'\r\nOption 1. Deploy to Heroku\r\nFollow [this link](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/tree/master) to deploy the latest stable Staticman code to Heroku.\r\nYou can enter your Staticman API config values as [Heroku config variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).\r\n(Optional) Create a fork of Staticman and set up a Heroku pipeline to deploy from the fork. This will help you to keep your instance up to date with the latest Staticman improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOption 2. Deploy to your own infrastructure\r\nIf you prefer to use Docker, check out the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/blob/master/docs/docker.md). Otherwise continue below\r\n\r\nClone [the Staticman repo](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman.git) and ensure node and npm are installed.\r\nInstall the dependencies\r\nnpm install\r\nCreate a new config from the sample\r\ncp config.sample.json config.production.json\r\nEdit the new production config with any values you want, and then start the Staticman server\r\nnpm start\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3. Create a site configuration file\r\nStaticman will look for a staticman.yml file in the root of the repository, where various configuration parameters will be defined. These configuration values are specific to the site. This means one Staticman instance can be used with many websites and users.\r\n\r\nYou can use the [sample site config file](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/blob/master/staticman.sample.yml) as a starting point and check the [available site configuration parameters](https://staticman.net/docs/configuration) for more information.\r\n```\r\n",

        "body": "Recently, VistaPanel hosts have been removed from the list of providers on Free-for-Dev, raising concerns among developers who have been using this hosting service. This issue aims to address the removal of VistaPanel hosts from the platform and clarify their authenticity as non-fake cPanel hosts.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nVistaPanel is a web hosting control panel that has been providing free hosting services to developers for several years. It offers a user-friendly interface with features similar to cPanel, making it a popular choice among developers, particularly those working on small projects or personal websites.\r\n\r\nIssue Details:\r\n\r\nRemoval of VistaPanel hosts: The sudden removal of VistaPanel hosts from the Free-for-Dev platform has left many developers puzzled and concerned. These hosts have been a reliable option for developers who require basic hosting functionalities without the need for advanced features provided by premium hosting services.\r\n\r\nAuthenticity concerns: It is important to note that VistaPanel hosts are NOT fake cPanel hosts. While cPanel is a widely recognized and powerful hosting control panel, VistaPanel is a separate, standalone control panel designed to provide a simplified hosting experience. The removal of VistaPanel hosts from Free-for-Dev may have inadvertently given the impression that they were illegitimate or fake.\r\n\r\nValue for developers: VistaPanel hosts have been a valuable resource for developers who are just starting out or have limited budgets. They provide an accessible platform for experimenting with web development projects, learning new technologies, and showcasing personal portfolios. Restoring VistaPanel hosts on Free-for-Dev would ensure that developers continue to have access to this free hosting option.\r\n\r\nDistinguishing VistaPanel from cPanel: To address any confusion surrounding VistaPanel, it would be helpful to provide a clear distinction between VistaPanel and cPanel hosts on the Free-for-Dev platform. This could include adding a separate category for VistaPanel hosts or clearly labeling them as \"VistaPanel\" to prevent any misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n\r\nRestore VistaPanel hosts: We request the Free-for-Dev platform administrators to consider bringing back VistaPanel hosts to the list of available hosting providers. This would allow developers to continue benefiting from the simplicity and accessibility that VistaPanel offers.\r\n\r\nClarify authenticity: To avoid any misunderstandings regarding the legitimacy of VistaPanel hosts, it would be beneficial to include a brief explanation or disclaimer emphasizing that VistaPanel is a distinct hosting control panel and not a fake version of cPanel.\r\n\r\nProvide distinction: Consider implementing visual or categorization changes on the Free-for-Dev platform to clearly differentiate between cPanel hosts and VistaPanel hosts. This could involve labeling VistaPanel hosts prominently or providing a separate category or section for them.\r\n\r\nBy addressing these concerns and taking the proposed actions, Free-for-Dev can continue to provide an inclusive and diverse selection of hosting options for developers, while acknowledging the unique value that VistaPanel hosts bring to the community.",
