This change will mark the standard transaction manager as primary one and it will be given preference when auto-wiring a dependency for standard use cases. And for the specific usecases they can use the custom transaction manager using `@Transactional` annotation. For ex:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Transactional(transactionManager = \"customTransactionManager\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

This is why it is currently limited to sorting them based solely on bean instances and not on their bean definitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a sealed marker interface for `ApplicationRunner` and `CommandLineRunner`.\r\nThen, using the interface to retrieve the beans in an ordered fashion, it takes into account the `@Order` on the bean definition(`@Bean` method in this case).\r\nThis allows for the use of `@Order` on `@Bean` methods for both `CommandLineRunner` and `ApplicationRunner`.\r\n",

With such a provider, the default behavior of auto-configuration to set `sessionTransacted` to `true` when `JtaTransactionManager` is not present results in a non-working setup that requires something along these lines:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Bean\r\nDefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory jmsListenerContainerFactory(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory,\r\n        DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer) {\r\n    DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory jmsListenerContainerFactory = new DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory();\r\n    configurer.configure(jmsListenerContainerFactory, connectionFactory);\r\n    jmsListenerContainerFactory.setSessionTransacted(false);\r\n    return jmsListenerContainerFactory;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not change the existing logic - if `spring.jms.listener.session-transacted` is not set, `sessionTransacted` will still be set based on presence of `JtaTransactionManager`.",

        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI find out following situation.\r\n\r\nI have Gradle build with `gradle bootBuildImage` command. When I run it with Gitlab CICD and it's usage of DinD where environment variable `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375` is specified, build fails on `java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out` exception below.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I found out that it is because of HTTP communication with Docker daemon where Apache HTTP Client has default read-timeout set to `3 minutes`.\r\n\r\nWhat I see in the log is:\r\n```\r\n    [creator]     [2/8] Performing analysis...

It shows steps to reproduce without starting full blown build process and is highly dependent on environment. Main point here is that we need to \"force\" code to select `RemoteHttpClientTransport` and not `LocalHttpClientTransport` instance during execution of `org.springframework.boot.buildpack.platform.docker.transport.HttpTransport#create`.\r\n\r\nAnother think is why you do not use docker-java project, because it seems from source code that they have already solved most of the edge cases with Docker deamon communication.\r\n\r\nThx for your feedback\r\n\r\nIvos\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Original

This is achieved through Gradle Enterprise injection, where an init-script will apply the Gradle Enterprise plugin and associated configuration.</p>\n<p>This feature can be useful to easily trial Gradle Enterprise on a project, or to centralize Gradle Enterprise configuration for all GitHub Actions workflows in an organization.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/blob/v2.8.0/README.md#gradle-enterprise-plugin-injection\">Gradle Enterprise injection in the README</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3>Restore Gradle User Home when directory already exists</h3>\n<p>Previously, the Gradle User Home would not be restored if the directory already exists. This wasn't normally an issue with GitHub-hosted runners, but limited the usefulness of the action for persistent, self-hosted runners.</p>\n<p>This behaviour has been improved in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Job Summary now includes a useful error message when Gradle User Home was not restored because the directory already exists.</li>\n<li>The action can now be configured to restore the Gradle User Home when the directory already exists, overwriting existing content with content from the GitHub Actions cache.

If the provider resolves to a unique object, that `AuthTokenManager` will have precedence over any static token.\r\n\r\nThe usecase for Neo4j users is to be able to define expiring tokens and the like. Without this addition, they must configure the driver bean completely on their own. The config customiser will not help them as the token manager is configured in parallel. This leads to a lot of unnecessary duplicated code and some things are not even obvious that they won't work anymore (such as the integration with Spring logging).\r\n\r\nThe `AuthTokenManager` interface is marked as preview as it will probably receive more methods, it't won't go away however the code does not depend on specifics.\r\n\r\nI tried adding the tests into unit scope, but the least bloated way is just running them as an integration test. To avoid having to start multiple containers, I used two nested tests in `Neo4jAutoConfigurationIntegrationTests`.",

You can read more about the Dependency Graph support in <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action#github-dependency-graph-support\">the README chapter</a>.</p>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to <a href=\"https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin/0.2.0\"><code>github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin@v0.2.0</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Dependency graph uses Gradle Settings file as manifest location (if Settings file exists)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Adds a <code>dependency-graph-file</code> output to any step that generates a Dependency Graph file</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0\">https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0</a></p>\n<h2>v2.6.1</h2>\n<h3>Dependency Graph support</h3>\n<p>This patch release fixes and improves a couple of aspects of the experimental Dependency Graph support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The action will now generate a unique <code>job.correlator</code> value for each Gradle invocation within a Job. This permits multiple Gradle invocations in a single job to generate and submit a separate dependency graph.</li>\n<li>Update to use <a href=\"https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin\"><code>github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin@v0.1.0</code></a>, which brings a number of improvements to the generated dependency graph:\n<ul>\n<li>Each Gradle build invocation is mapped to a single GitHub Dependency Graph manifest. This should result in fewer duplicate security alerts being generated.</li>\n<li>Configurations that contribute to the GitHub Dependency Graph can be filtered by regular expression</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/a4cf152f482c7ca97ef56ead29bf08bcd953284c\"><code>a4cf152</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/issues/817\">#817</a> from gradle/dd/270</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/a8aac055e2deab8d6d8f1b3db3b641f7d0d1fb13\"><code>a8aac05</code></a> Build outputs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/7241fa5d56e140ce86bde3d244e67600da8a6049\"><code>7241fa5</code></a> Add new output to Action.yml</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/9e58f8b1dea90e41eb8549225a965bcc191a48ef\"><code>9e58f8b</code></a> Add dependency-graph-file as step output</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/632e888003b59f452af3078ef22260d97720e3f5\"><code>632e888</code></a> Update to the latest dependency-graph plugin</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/ced6859e9c4c384100f94984814deb1bd361f648\"><code>ced6859</code></a> Update Build Scan\u2122 to Build Scan\u00ae</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/0904709a467afe43e1eea3eab17a838c884a8013\"><code>0904709</code></a> Bump GE plugin versions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/1b94073332d9e2719d696b8605c4c018939f310b\"><code>1b94073</code></a> Bump development dependencies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/4821f54162a08dd149926ca73cba14bad773b536\"><code>4821f54</code></a> Group all npm dependencies in a single dependabot PR</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/commit/2dbad1ea2d2916872bb086f4cde9f8734ec648b0\"><code>2dbad1e</code></a> Bump the github-actions group with 1 update</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/compare/bd5760595778326ba7f1441bcf7e88b49de61a25...a4cf152f482c7ca97ef56ead29bf08bcd953284c\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gradle/gradle-build-action&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=2.6.0&new-version=2.7.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

        "body": "In this pull request I added an explicit zero order to the ` ProblemDetailsExceptionHandler` beans for WebMVC and Webflux.\r\n\r\nWithout the order, it means these beans automatically have the lowest precedence, and they will usually be executed last. This can be problematic when someone would like to create a \u201ccatch-all\u201d `@ExceptionHandler` in a `@ControllerAdvice` bean. Meaning an exception handler that should handle any exception that was not handled by any other exception handler with.\r\nSuch an exception handler should have the absolute lowest precedence, and the `ProblemDetailsExceptionHandler` must have a higher precedence. However, because both now have the same precedence, it is not a guarantee that this will be the case. In my tests, my own catch-all exception handler would always start handling those exceptions that should be handled by the `ProblemDetailsExceptionHandler`.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to create custom beans that implement `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` and give those an order that has a higher precedence then my catch-all exception handler. However, I don\u2019t think this should be necessary.\r\n\r\nBecause the `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` has a defined list of exceptions it is going to handle, there should be no issue in it having a specific order by default. If it has the order `0` then anyone can easily create an exception handler that has a higher or lower precedence. \r\n\r\nI created a test which shows the issue, and the current workaround:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mzeijen/spring-boot-problem-support/blob/main/src/test/java/com/example/demo/ResponseEntityExceptionHandlerOrderingTest.java\r\n\r\nThis test has nested test classes which show the difference in behavior for both WebMVC and Webflux, when the default `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` are used or when the workaround is applied.\r\n\r\nIn the pull request I added a test that verifies that the ordering takes effect.",

Thank you for your efforts.",

It also adds support for a new propagation type, `B3_MULTI` (which is B3 with multiple headers instead of the single `b3` header).\r\n\r\nThere are now two new properties:\r\n\r\n* `management.tracing.propagation.consume` which controls which trace formats the application will understand on incoming requests. It defaults to all known trace formats (W3C, B3 single, B3 multi).\r\n* `management.tracing.propagation.produce` which controls which trace formats the application will add to outgoing requests. It defaults to W3C.\r\n\r\nThe `management.tracing.propagation.type` has been changed from `PropagationType` to `List<PropagationType>` and the default has been removed. If set, this will override both `management.tracing.propagation.consume` and `management.tracing.propagation.produce`.\r\n\r\nThe formats have an ordering, meaning that if one of the extractors matches, the one after it are no longer considered. The default ordering is:\r\n\r\n1. W3C\r\n2. B3 single\r\n3. B3 multi\r\n\r\nThe `CompositePropagationFactory` is the main piece of code for Brave which knows how to extract and inject multiple formats. It's a copy from Sleuth, somewhat refactored.\r\n\r\nThe `CompositeTextMapPropagator` is the main piece of code for OTel. It's somewhat more complicated than the Brave pendant as we need to support the `BaggageTextMapPropagator` which must run always even if one of the extractors before it has already extracted the context.\r\n\r\nI also removed a `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` for type `B3Propagator` and `W3CTraceContextPropagator`. This should be fine as it's not consistent anyway. In the `bagagge = true` case those `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` are not effective but the extractors are added unconditionally in `w3cTextMapPropagatorWithBaggage` and `b3BaggageTextMapPropagator`.\r\n\r\n## Property examples\r\n\r\n* To only use B3 single, set `management.tracing.propagation.type` to `B3`\r\n* To only use B3 multi, set `management.tracing.propagation.type` to `B3_MULTI`\r\n* To only use W3C multi, set `management.tracing.propagation.type` to `W3C`\r\n\r\n* To produce B3 single and W3C and accept W3C, B3 single and multi, set `management.tracing.propagation.produce` to `B3,W3C` and `management.tracing.propagation.consume` to `B3,B3_MULTI,W3C`\r\n\r\nSee gh-35096",

It said like below.\r\n> Considering that framework expects a single bean of that type for unqualified `@Transactional` use, I think we should refine our auto-configuration to avoid that by default.\r\n\r\nI also agreed with it, but I made this PR because when I develop a spring batch application with jdbc for `JobRepository` and r2dbc for main service and repository logic, I figured out this condition of the autoconfiguration prevents registering the required jdbc transactionmanager. Please give your opinion about this and I can close this PR or modify PR only for fixing the existing test.",

        "body": "Hi, I'm trying to use the new feature of Spring Batch 5 that let you set a job parameter of any kind of type.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that you have to provide a `Converter` from your custom parameter type to `String` because Spring Batch needs it, but the only way to register this new converter is extending `DefaultBatchConfiguration` and overriding the `getConverterService()` method. This however switches off the spring boot autoconfiguration for Spring Batch, which seems a bit extreme just to register a simple converter.\r\n\r\nI created a small project to demonstrate my situation https://github.com/EvaristeGalois11/spring-batch-parameter\r\n\r\nIn this small project i rely on the spring boot autoconfiguration to initialize the database schema needed by Spring Batch.\r\n\r\nThe `WithoutConverterTest` test case fails because the converter isn't registered, but the `WithConverterTest` test case fails too because the spring boot autoconfiguration isn't activated and the tables aren't being created.\r\n\r\n### Possible solution ###\r\nMy simple idea to resolve the problem is to provide a bean similar to `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer`.\r\nIf the spring boot autoconfiguration finds some beans of this type, the `ConfigurableConversionService` returned from `DefaultBatchConfiguration:getConverterService()` is enriched accordingly. This will permit registering a new converter without disrupting the autoconfiguration execution.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, bye!",

something else that is the issue at hand here. :thinking: Presuming it _can_ be the documentation, but feel free to reject this if you are 100% certain that this works on more recent versions of Spring Boot.\r\n\r\n(I have only been testing this on Spring Boot 2.4.0. I tested upgrading to 2.7.0, but it caused non-trivial issues when running my app. Can revisit that if you want help validating that this is indeed an issue on 2.7.0 as well. 3.x is harder in my case since our app is Java 11 ATM.)",

If other loggers are still printing logs (such as `org.springframework.jndi.JndiTemplate` which reads environment variable values from `<springProperty scope=\"context\" ...>`), a warning `noAppenderDefinedWarning` will be issued, causing `StatusPrinter.printInCaseOfErrorsOrWarnings(loggerContext)` to be executed.

        "body": "Hi, when scanning the spring issues, I have found one problem related to spring-boot which has been depicted in this website(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29725).\r\nIn my opinion, TaskExecutionAutoConfiguration should import task executor only when develops not set one executor with specific name. It is very likely that develops add Executor bean not used for task executor--This would indirectly lead to spring use SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor to handle async events(which would always start one new thread when events come).\r\nMy PR is to solve this problem. There might be other solutions like: \r\n1. Extending @ConditionalOnMissingBean to support And/Or logic(Current implementation use Or logic--types or names or annotation) which is really one break change. \r\n2. Simply modify TaskExecutionAutoConfiguration to @ConditionalOnMissingBean(TaskExecutor.class). But from my own experience, a wide range of develops tend to just autowire Executor bean instead of TaskExecutor.\r\n\r\nOverall I prefer to minimize the impact only within the TaskExecutionAutoConfiguration which leads to this PR--If developers want to autowire own Executor bean as the task executor, they should specify bean name(Or who knows its Executor serve for what, maybe it just wants to serve their own tasks when task execution must not share).\r\n\r\nThis PR has one potential problem: After those developers who not specify task executor name have upgraded their spring-boot to this version, they might encounter capacity shortage problem(TaskExecutionProperties default coreSize=8).\r\n\r\nWelcome to discuss! Thanks for your time!",

        "body": "This PR introduces support for Spring Authorization Server. It includes:\r\n\r\n* New module `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-authorization-server`\r\n* Dependency management of `org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server`\r\n* Support in `spring-boot-autoconfigure` for `org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server`\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe auto-configuration is designed to closely match the [Getting Started](https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html) guide in the reference manual. When `spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server` is detected on the classpath, the following components are optionally registered:\r\n\r\n* `RegisteredClientRepository`\r\n* `AuthorizationServerSettings`\r\n* `SecurityFilterChain` for [protocol endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/protocol-endpoints.html)\r\n* `SecurityFilterChain` for user authentication with Form Login\r\n* `com.nimbusds.jose.jwk.source.JWKSource<SecurityContext>` with a generated RSA key-pair\r\n* `JwtDecoder` that uses the provided `JWKSource`\r\n\r\nBecause Spring Authorization Server is built on top of Spring Security, the order in which components are registered in collaboration with existing auto-configuration is important.\r\n\r\nThe main consideration is that `UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration` continue to be allowed to publish a `UserDetailsService` if necessary. However, a `JwtDecoder` must also be published afterwards. This is in-contrast with `OAuth2ResourceServerAutoConfiguration` which prevents a `UserDetailsService` from being published.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `OAuth2AuthorizationServerProperties` allow configuring `RegisteredClient`s and `AuthorizationServerSettings`. Here is a typical client configuration with default settings:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspring:\r\n  security:\r\n    oauth2:\r\n      authorizationserver:\r\n        client:\r\n          messaging-client:\r\n            registration:\r\n              client-id: messaging-client\r\n              client-secret: \"{noop}secret\"\r\n              client-authentication-methods:\r\n                - client_secret_basic\r\n              authorization-grant-types:\r\n                - authorization_code\r\n                - refresh_token\r\n                - client_credentials\r\n              redirect-uris:\r\n                - http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/messaging-client-oidc\r\n                - http://127.0.0.1:8080/authorized\r\n              scopes:\r\n                - openid\r\n                - profile\r\n                - message.read\r\n                - message.write\r\n            require-authorization-consent: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a full configuration example:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspring:\r\n  security:\r\n    oauth2:\r\n      authorizationserver:\r\n        issuer: https://provider.com\r\n        endpoint:\r\n          authorization-uri: /oauth2/authorize\r\n          token-uri: /oauth2/token\r\n          jwk-set-uri: /oauth2/jwks\r\n          token-revocation-uri: /oauth2/revoke\r\n          token-introspection-uri: /oauth2/introspect\r\n          oidc:\r\n            logout-uri: /connect/logout\r\n            client-registration-uri: /connect/register\r\n            user-info-uri: /userinfo\r\n        client:\r\n          messaging-client:\r\n            registration:\r\n              client-id: messaging-client\r\n              client-secret: \"{noop}secret\"\r\n              client-name: Messaging Client\r\n              client-authentication-methods:\r\n                - client_secret_basic\r\n              authorization-grant-types:\r\n                - authorization_code\r\n                - refresh_token\r\n                - client_credentials\r\n                - urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code\r\n              redirect-uris:\r\n                - http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/messaging-client-oidc\r\n                - http://127.0.0.1:8080/authorized\r\n              post-logout-redirect-uris:\r\n                - http://127.0.0.1:8080/logout\r\n              scopes:\r\n                - openid\r\n                - profile\r\n                - message.read\r\n                - message.write\r\n            require-proof-key: true\r\n            require-authorization-consent: true\r\n            jwk-set-uri: http://127.0.0.1:8080/jwks\r\n            token-endpoint-authentication-signing-algorithm: RS256\r\n            token:\r\n              authorization-code-time-to-live: 5m\r\n              access-token-time-to-live: 5m\r\n              access-token-format: self-contained\r\n              reuse-refresh-tokens: false\r\n              refresh-token-time-to-live: 60m\r\n```",

But it seems that customization logic should live there, not validation logic? I can override the other method instead of runScripts if that is at all preferable.\r\n\r\nit seems there is already an architectural decision in place here - to deal with the configuring the different implementations - all the implementations of `DataSourceScriptDatabaseInitializer` need to call the super constructor taking `DataSource` and `DatabaseInitializationSettings` as the second argument. perhaps it makes sense to augment the database initialization settings to add the necessary information to perform this particular kind of validation... then this solution will more easily translate to other implementations. otherwise it is less than ideal to hook into the constructors and store the implementation-specific ConfigurationProperties object.",
