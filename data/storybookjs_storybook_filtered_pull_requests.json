Any help with that would be appreciated.\r\n- I have implemented new Figma [design changes](https://www.figma.com/file/0aE15x7mawaneALFjEXx5k/Storybook-UI?type=design&node-id=82-11504&mode=design&t=fevRZ9C3bohZY5uD-0) as part of our ongoing effort to update Storybook components. I'm unsure if this was a good decision.\r\n- The `font-size` is being applied in pixels, but it would be more accessible that they were specified in `rem`, so that they reacted to the users' browsers settings. Would that be a welcome addition for the `DropdownMenu` + sub-components in this PR?\r\n- The replaced `ListItem` had `left` and `right` properties, which allowed various elements, including keyboard shortcuts. However, this hindered accessibility, as those require adding `aria-keyshortcuts` to the parent container for screen reader users to understand keyboard shortcuts. What are your thoughts on the new `DropdownMenu.Item` props? Do they cover all use-cases, or should they be more flexible?\r\n- Several end-to-end tests are broken (due to code prior to this PR). Are they being addressed? If not, I'm willing to contribute with some of the necessary fixes.",

Sometimes, due to various configurations or linking strategies, these dependencies might get loaded more than once. This results in multiple distinct instances of the same library coexisting in the runtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using the instanceof operator to check if an object is an instance of a particular constructor or class, JavaScript checks against a specific prototype/reference. If two versions (or instances) of a library are loaded in a monorepository, the prototype of a class from one instance is not the same as the prototype of the same class from another instance. This can cause the instanceof checks to fail even when, from a logical perspective, they shouldn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nIn the context of our Angular decorators (like Component or Directive), the instanceof operator might give incorrect results if, for instance, one part of the monorepo references one instance/version of @angular/core and another part references a different instance. This can lead to situations where an object that logically is an instance of Component is not recognized as such by the instanceof check.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo address this, we're moving away from using instanceof for type checks. Instead, we're leveraging Angular's internal property ngMetadataName, which is set on decorators like Component, Directive, etc., during the compilation phase. This property provides a string representation of the decorator's type, making it a reliable way to determine the type of decorator, irrespective of how many instances of @angular/core are loaded.\r\n\r\nBy implementing the isDecoratorInstanceOf function and using the ngMetadataName property, we can ensure consistent and accurate type checks across all projects in the monorepository, eliminating the quirks introduced by the instanceof operator in this specific context.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nManual testing not required\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to indicate which documentation has been updated. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add or update documentation reflecting your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

The primary goal of this utility is to seamlessly handle both property bindings and event bindings, aligning closely with Angular's practices.\r\n\r\n**Highlights**:\r\n\r\n1. **Event Binding Recognition**: The function identifies if an argument value is a function. If true, it considers this as an Angular event binding, accommodating scenarios like button clicks or other custom component events.\r\n\r\n2. **Efficient Filtering**: Leveraging the `Set` data structure allows for efficient filtering of included or excluded keys.\r\n\r\n3. **Descriptive Types**: The `ArgsToTemplateOptions` interface has been introduced to provide a clear understanding of the options passed to the function.\r\n\r\n**Examples and Motivations**:\r\n\r\nThis utility addresses two key challenges with Angular in the context of Storybook:\r\n- Angular treats undefined values in property bindings as actual values, inhibiting the default values' application. This behavior is often non-intuitive and has been a bug source.\r\n- The earlier setup, while utilizing a default property value, didn't offer users control override capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe new utility ensures that component templates align better with Angular's expected behaviors and provides robust support for Storybook controls.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**:\r\n\r\nIn-depth inline comments and JSDoc descriptions have been added to elucidate the function's behavior and the introduced interface. An example has also been provided, showcasing the function in a real-world context.\r\n\r\n**Request for Review**:\r\n\r\nFeedback on the utility, especially potential edge cases or areas for further enhancement, would be greatly valued.\r\n\r\n**Additional work**:\r\n\r\n- Angular Stories were converted from CSF2 to CSF3\r\n- Updated documentation\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.

For additional guidance: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/contribute/how-to-contribute\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to migrate from Jest to Vitest.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure how reviewable this PR is. There is just an incredible amount of changes that might crash the diff view in Github \ud83d\ude28\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote a codemod to do most of the manual labor and you can find it here: https://go.intuita.io/IX3EFT\r\n\r\nThe codemod takes care of:\r\n\r\n1. JSDOM environment comments\r\n```ts\r\n// from\r\n/**\r\n * @jest-environment jsdom\r\n */\r\n\r\n// to\r\n/**\r\n * @vitest-environment jsdom\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Type reference comments\r\n```ts\r\n// from\r\n/// <reference types=\"@types/jest\" />;\r\n\r\n// to\r\n/// <reference types=\"vitest\" />;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. All sorts of spy/mock/fn migrations\r\n```ts\r\n// from\r\njest.mock('@storybook/preview-api');\r\nconst value = jest.requireActual('@storybook/preview-api');\r\nconst value2 = jest.createMockFromModule('@storybook/preview-api');\r\nconst myMock = jest.fn();\r\nconst spy = jest.spyOn(EventsPackageExport, 'bla');\r\n\r\n// to\r\nimport { vi } from \"vitest\";\r\n\r\nvi.mock('@storybook/preview-api');\r\nconst value = await vi.importActual('@storybook/preview-api');\r\nconst value2 = vi.mock('@storybook/preview-api')\r\nconst myMock = vi.fn();\r\nconst spy = vi.spyOn(EventsPackageExport, 'bla');\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. All sorts of TypeScript type migrations\r\n```ts\r\n// from\r\nconst mockedApi = api as unknown as jest.Mocked<api.API>;\r\nconst toIdMock = toId as jest.Mock<ReturnType<typeof toId>>;\r\nlet mockChannel: { on: jest.Mock; emit?: jest.Mock };\r\n(helpers.isNxProject as jest.SpyInstance).mockResolvedValue(true);\r\n\r\n// to\r\nimport { Mock, Mocked, SpyInstance } from \"vitest\";\r\n\r\nconst mockedApi = api as unknown as Mocked<api.API>;\r\nconst toIdMock = toId as Mock<ReturnType<typeof toId>>;\r\nlet mockChannel: { on: Mock; emit?: Mock };\r\n(helpers.isNxProject as SpyInstance).mockResolvedValue(true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nApart from adding missing imports for `describe, it, test, beforeEach, beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll`, etc.\r\n\r\nTo sum the changes up:\r\n- Codemod ran across all files in the codebase\r\n- storyshots and storyshots-puppeteer packages are deleted. (they are deprecated, and in Storybook 8 they would be removed. Else we'd need to do a rework on them for proper ESM support)\r\n- Mocking mechanism changed e.g.\r\n- A lot of snapshots are updated\r\n- Some package.json exports were changed\r\n- jest config files were turned into vitest config files\r\n- `jest-os-detection` (for windowsOnly tests) usage was replaced with a small local utility\r\n- `jest-specific-snapshot` was replaced with Vitest's own snapshot utility\r\n\r\n\r\n## What still needs to be done\r\n\r\n\r\n### Out of memory issue - Solved!\r\n\r\n~When running the tests, the process hangs for about 3min and then presents the following error message:\r\n<img width=\"651\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/assets/1671563/f85a3526-00e2-48d2-83c8-0287270ff62d\">~\r\n\r\n~This has to be investigated and fixed.~\r\n\r\nFixed by https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/24415/commits/6d35099f00af18056ec2dc01537b237f4acff3da\r\n\r\n### Emotion loading twice\r\n\r\nIt seems that @emotion/react is being loaded in two different contexts, which causes the theme to be lost, and some tests to fail. It's unclear what is causing this.  This is breaking tests in `addons/interactions`, `addons/a11y`, and `ui/blocks`, and `ui/manager`.\r\n\r\n### Call counts in StoryIndexGenerator tests are off by one\r\n\r\n`AssertionError: expected \"N\" to be called 6 times, but got 5 times`.  It's unclear what caused this, or whether it is truly broken.  This breaks tests in `lib/core-server`.\r\n\r\n### Failing tests\r\n\r\nAs of the time of writing this, 2296 tests are passing and 91 tests are failing.\r\n\r\nThe failures are in the following files:\r\n\r\n- [x] lib/node-logger/src/index.test.ts\r\n- [x] lib/cli/src/helpers.test.ts\r\n- [x] builders/builder-vite/src/vite-config.test.ts\r\n- [x] renderers/vue/src/public-types.test.ts\r\n- [x] lib/core-common/src/presets.test.ts\r\n- [x] renderers/svelte/src/public-types.test.ts\r\n- [x] renderers/vue3/src/public-types.test.ts\r\n- [ ] src/modules/store/StoryStore.test.ts\r\n- [x] lib/core-server/src/utils/StoryIndexGenerator.test.ts\r\n- [x] lib/core-server/src/utils/stories-json.test.ts\r\n- [x] src/tests/util.test.js\r\n- [ ] src/components/A11YPanel.test.tsx\r\n- [x] src/components/A11yContext.test.tsx\r\n- [x] src/components/Report/HighlightToggle.test.tsx\r\n- [x] src/react/components/link.test.tsx\r\n- [x] src/components/typography/link/link.test.tsx\r\n- [x] src/modules/preview-web/PreviewWeb.test.ts\r\n- [x] src/utils/StoryIndexGenerator.deprecated.test.ts\r\n- [x] src/automigrate/fixes/cra5.test.ts\r\n- [x] src/automigrate/fixes/webpack5.test.ts\r\n- [x] src/__test__/composeStories.test.tsx\r\n- [ ] src/components/VisionSimulator.test.tsx\r\n\r\nyou can run `yarn test:watch <filepath>` for a \"focused test fixing session\"\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nRun `yarn test` or `yarn test:watch` in the `code` directory.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to indicate which documentation has been updated. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add or update documentation reflecting your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

        "body": "Closes https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/24357\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses a critical dependency issue that arose with upgrading the file-system-cache package to version 2.4.0 and now having a new `types-ramda` version published yesterday. The specific version depends on @types/ramda, which, in turn, requires Typescript version 5. Our project aims to maintain compatibility with Typescript version 4 to ensure seamless integration with Storybook and Angular 15, which is scaffolded with Typescript 4.x. However, the recent changes in @types/ramda have led to a broken setup since it now utilizes types-ramda, introducing Typescript syntax exclusive to version 5. This scenario manifested yesterday, disrupting the normal operation of our development environment.\r\n\r\nTo rectify this and restore the compatibility of our setup with Typescript 4.x, we are downgrading the file-system-cache package to version 2.3.0. This version does not have the problematic dependency version on @types/ramda and will ensure our setup remains functional and compatible with the existing toolchain, including Storybook and Angular 15.\r\n\r\nFurthermore\r\n\r\n- Updated yarn.lock and pinned some packages to exact versions\r\n- the Angular 15 sandbox is readded to the CI\r\n- the `debugWebpack` CLI option was added to the Angular builder\r\n- tightened the supported zone.js version range\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nManual testing is not required, since it is covered by CI\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [x] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

We had a logic in place when detecting the project type which would fail in this scenario, leaving the CLI hanging forever, and also affecting users because it would not be able to detect Nextjs. This PR fixes that and sets `debug` as default when generating sandboxes, so it saves us time to figure out what is going on.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to indicate which documentation has been updated. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add or update documentation reflecting your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

The main concept here is to make it more of an atomic version that can be used anywhere.

It also work with the existing icons library as well as our new icon library.\r\n- No breaking changes for 8.0.\r\n- One button to rule them all. We are removing all the need for special button instances.\r\n- We are keeping the `children` prop as it is.\r\n- new `asChild` prop to allow for a custom wrapper (for `<Link>` or `<a />`).\r\n- `IconButton` is now just a wrapper around `Button` with special props.\r\n- Match design of old props to the closest version we have in the new design.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [x] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.

Previously this was done using `event.target`, and I changed that to use `event.composedPath()[0]` instead, so that stories which render an input / textarea or contenteditable element within a shadow tree don't spuriously trigger storybook shortcuts.\r\n\r\nThe linked issue has a reproducible example of the bug.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\nI made sure there are no regressions in the e2e tests and updated the unit tests. However I did not implement new tests for stories including a shadow tree.

I use react and it would require to create a new react-only story and add the react-shadow dependency.\r\n\r\nInstead, I checked my change manually within another project:\r\n\r\n- Checkout https://github.com/zakodium-oss/react-science\r\n- Run `npm ci`\r\n- Run `npm run storybook`\r\n- Run `npx serve storybook-static`\r\n- Go to one of the \"Input\" stories\r\n- Type \"s\" in the input => it toggles the sidebar\r\n- Edit `./storybook-static/sb-preview/runtime.js`, replace `let target = event.target;` with `let target = event.composedPath()[0]`\r\n- Reload the input story and check that when in the input, typing `s` does not toggle the sidebar as expected. When focused element is within the preview but not the input, type `s` does toggle the sidebar as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to indicate which documentation has been updated. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add or update documentation reflecting your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

The release preparation PR from next will automatically target `latest-release` if a non-prerelease version bump is chosen.\r\n2. It will then merge `latest-release` into the branch, resolving any conflicts to the branch's content - to solve any merge conflicts.\r\n3. when the PR has been merged and published, it will be merged from `latest-release` to `main` as usual - this shouldn't cause any merge conflicts given that they have already been resolved.\r\n4. when it's on `main`, we trigger a preminor version bump on `next` to ensure `next` is always one minor version ahead of `main`.\r\n\r\n- Closes #23886 \r\n- renames workflow from \"prerelease\" to \"non-patch-release\"\r\n- When a publish workflow starts it will now immediately cancel any preparation workflows to avoid race conditions.\r\n\r\n<!-- Briefly describe what your PR does -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nWe need to test this out manually, however it's very hard to do.

For example, when using vite and HMR, svelte generate a proxy named `Proxy<Component>` and Storybook was displaying this name instead of the real component name.\r\n\r\nThis PR always injects documentation metadata, with the real name of the component (build at compile time).\r\n\r\nMoreover, sveltedoc-parser is configured to parse ecmascript v9 and fails to parse elvis operator, or \"??\". This PR also change sveltedoc-parser to enable ecmascript v12. However, the configuration is not officially exposed so I have to patch the lib..

Only the Angular prerelease is on the Node 18 path, but it's set up so it's trivial to move other sandboxes over later.\r\n- Merged the generate sandbox workflows for `main` and `next` into one, using the strategy matrix feature instead.\r\n- Extracted Angular prerelease sandbox out of the regular CircleCI flow and into it's own separate that runs on Node 18. This is can also be duplicated later for other sandboxes, it's a bit hacky though. \r\n\r\n<!-- Briefly describe what your PR does -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [x] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [x] integration tests\r\n- [x] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n1.

This was the case in Storybook 6.5, and it stopped working because of changes in the webpack-dev-middleware library. This PR brings that behavior back.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.

This PR adds an error handler at the earliest moment possible in the CLI, so we can advise users in known error scenarios such as the `string-width` issue.\r\n\r\n- **Can telemetry be sent for such errors?** \r\n   No. This is the earliest moment in the code execution and it does not depend on any module imports, so the chance of some code breaking because of an unresolved/failed import (which is what string-width issue is about) is zero this way. If we tried to do more, the code could break before even registering the error handler.\r\n- **Can we use the categorized errors here?**\r\n   No. Same reason as above\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.

Configuring those to use the `.nvmrc` file would be involved. It might be possible with [Dynamic configs](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/) although maybe not worth it.\r\n- RFC feedback suggests not using the `.nvmrc` node version in the publish script.

This won't guarantee that Vite 5 works, but it's at least a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nTechnically this doesn't make much of a difference because `main.js` isn't loaded by Vite, but rather by esbuild-register because it's server-only, but I think it's a good upgrade for users.\r\n\r\n<!-- Briefly describe what your PR does -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nI manually tested this in a React-Vite sandbox by renaming the `main.js` file to `main.cjs` and `main.cts`, which caused the deprecation warning to appear.

It correctly does not appear in a plain `main.js` file with `export default config;`. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the steps to test your changes here. For example:\r\n\r\n1.

That way, addon authors can support both the old and new API by setting both properties and not get punished with a deprecation warning. In SB 7.5.0 `storyIndexers` will simply be ignored, while previous versions will ignore `experimental_indexers`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nI tested this by adding `features: { storyStoreV7: false }` to the configuration and saw the deprecation warning in both `dev` and `build`.

This happens because webpack inlines the contents of `context.ts` instead of keeping the import statement intact.\r\n\r\nSince we want to reuse the same context everywhere we should make sure webpack preserves the import even after building, which can be done by marking `context.ts` as an external file that shouldn't be included in the output bundle.\r\n\r\nNote we also need to mark `decorator.tsx` as external, or else it will be included in the `preview.js` bundle, causing the import of `context.ts` to fail.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\nIf you look at the current output you can see `ImageContext` being recreated in every file it's imported.\r\nFor example in `dist/preview.js`, `dist/images/next-image.js` or  `dist/images/next-legacy-image.js` you will see the following line:\r\n```js\r\nImageContext=(0,import_react.createContext)({})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter building this branch the output instead turns into\r\n```js\r\nvar import_decorator = require(\"./images/decorator\");\r\n```\r\nfor `preview.js` and \r\n```js\r\nvar import_context = require(\"./context\");\r\n```\r\nfor `decorator.js` and finally\r\n```js\r\nvar import_context = require(\"./context\");\r\n```\r\nfor `next-image.js`, `next-legacy-image.js`, and` next-future-image.js`, which means the context is correctly being reused instead of recreated.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure your changes are tested (stories and/or unit, integration, or end-to-end tests)\r\n- [x] Make sure to add/update documentation regarding your changes\r\n- [x] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n#### Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

Unfortunately as I mentioned above, sometimes `api.getAddonState()`, which is the value of the parameter `c` of the callback in `setCount()`, results in `undefined`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by providing `defaultState` when `c` is undefined in `useSharedState()`.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the steps to test your changes here.

        "body": "## What I did\r\n\r\nWhen adding the API to set this from `manager.ts` I discovered the `setConfig` API seems broken due to a race condition between the manager UI rendering async and the manager being initiated before the `manager.ts` file is executed.\r\n\r\nThis was the order of operation:\r\n1. CONSTRUCT - `manager-api` context is contructed. The initial state is set.\r\n2. RENDER - the manager UI renders\r\n3. MANAGER - the `manager.ts` code is executed\r\n4.

Access Stories >  renderers > vue3_vue3-vite-default-ts > Reactive Slots  > Docs\r\n4. See aforementioned behavior on the slots controls.\r\n5. Edit any of the slots by clicking Raw button and Updating it with a double quoted string.\r\n6. Unfocus on the input\r\n7.

I will review them with @cdedreuille.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to use any component as the `DropdownMenu.Trigger`, while maintaining consistent styles for its `DropdownMenu.Content` and `DropdownMenu.Item` components. These styles mirror those found in the legacy Storybook drop-downs, which were originally constructed using the aforementioned components. By introducing this new component, we not only enhance accessibility, but also eliminate the complex inter-dependencies that existed among the former components required to build a dropdown in Storybook.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n- Run a sandbox from a template\r\n- Open Storybook\r\n- Visit \"DropdownMenu\" stories from the Core UI section\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure your changes are tested (stories and/or unit, integration, or end-to-end tests)\r\n- [x] Make sure to add/update documentation regarding your changes\r\n- [x] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n#### Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [x] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

Because this is quite a consequent change, Im setting this up as a separate layout that you can activate by setting the prop `newLayout` to `true` on the `<App />` component. That way we can slowly work on this new layout without breaking the old version.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reason we want to have a new layout is to break the concept that we have `<Mobile />` below 600px and `<Desktop />` above that. Today, this separation is creating a complete re-render making you loose your state. We hope to solve that by unifying both.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n1. Run Storybook UI locally with `yarn storybook:ui`\r\n2. Go to http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/manager-app-new--default\r\n3.

I know this has been a feature that has been requested many times for a varied use-cases.\r\n\r\nI've implemented the actual filtering in the sidebar, but this code will likely need optimization.\r\nAnd with this optimization there will be assumptions in when the filters are re-evaluated.\r\n\r\nA `FilterFunction` receives an (with status extended) `IndexHash_Item` and returns a boolean.\r\nStorybook will only ask to filter leaf-items (story and docs).\r\nStorybook will filter out empty components/groups/roots for you.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\nThis API can be used via from `manager.ts`:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { addons } from '@storybook/manager-api';\r\nimport startCase from 'lodash/startCase.js';\r\n\r\naddons.setConfig({\r\n  sidebar: {\r\n    filters: {\r\n      a: (item) => item.depth === 2,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected result is that the sidebar stories are filtered.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to make sure your PR is ready to be reviewed. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure your changes are tested (stories and/or unit, integration, or end-to-end tests)\r\n- [ ] Make sure to add/update documentation regarding your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n#### Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

        "body": "## What I did\r\n\r\nThis PR is introducing a new layout for Storybook on mobile. Because this is quite a consequent change, Im setting this up as a separate layout that you can activate by setting the prop `newLayout` to `true` on the `<App />` component. That way we can slowly work on this new layout without breaking the old version.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reason we want to have a new layout is to break the concept that we have `<Mobile />` below 600px and `<Desktop />` above that. Today, this separation is creating a complete re-render making you loose your state. We hope to solve that by unifying both.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n1. Run Storybook UI locally with `yarn storybook:ui`\r\n2. Go to http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/manager-app-new--default\r\n3.

        "body": "Closes #23661\r\n\r\n**Warning**: This PR seems to break the rendering of `<InlineStory />` in docs pages. Please **do not** accept this PR until the issue related to the rendering of `<InlineStory />` is resolved.\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nWhile I was investigating #23661, I noticed `next`'s webpack resolves `react` and `react-dom` differently. Specifically, it resolves them to the pre-compiled versions that reside in `next/dist/compiled/react` and `next/dist/compiled/react-dom` respectively: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/ff5338ce03a3240a97a5c84f5ad5c31c0f53a6ce/packages/next/src/build/webpack-config.ts#L1370-L1379.\r\n\r\nI speculate these pre-compiled `react` and `react-dom` are from [Canary channel](https://react.dev/community/versioning-policy#canary-channel) of React, which contains some undocumented / experimental APIs that are not available in [Latest channel](https://react.dev/community/versioning-policy#latest-channel).\r\n\r\n`next` uses these experimental versions of `react` and `react-dom` because some of their components (e.g., `next/image`) depends on the APIs provided by them.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific, the root cause of #23661 is the introduction of a new dependency in `next/image` (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/52425) that is not available in `react-dom@latest`: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/7d57784fc0585cb9e5394b982761a840a6554515/packages/next/src/client/image-component.tsx#L13. (i.e., `ReactDOM.preload()`).\r\n\r\nSo I added the same aliases to `@Storybook/nextjs` so that `next/image` doesn't break in the storybook webpack server.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this introduces a new bug where the `<Canvas />` (or more specifically `<InlineStory />` in the Canvas) doesn't render the story component properly:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-01 at 10 49 42 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/assets/71210554/4f7c625d-9c9d-45c6-a557-1377697487f9\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReact _does_ throw an error that says `Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.` when I leave the docs page and enter a story page, but other than that I'm pretty much clueless why the change I made affects the rendering of `<InlineStory />` \ud83d\ude05.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be much appreciated if the core team members shed some lights in this issue so that eventually we can resolve #23661.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the steps to test your changes here.

If your PR is related to an issue, provide the number(s) above; if it resolves multiple issues, be sure to break them up (e.g. \"closes #1000, closes #1001\"). -->\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nThis PR does multiple things (shame on me. Sorry.)\r\n\r\n### 1. Replaces all the internal _story_ indexes with the new API:\r\n\r\n- CSF indexer\r\n- Stories MDX indexer\r\n- Server indexer\r\n\r\n### 2. Handle `docsOnly` mode in Stories MDX\r\n\r\nThe new indexer handler now automatically removes story entries that are `docsOnly`\\*, as defined by having the `\"docsOnly\"` tag. So the Stories MDX indexer now adds that tag when it sees `parameters.docsOnly`, which is actually set by `CsfFile.parse()` \ud83e\udd75. \r\n\r\n\\* `docsOnly` is a feature exclusive to Stories MDX, and happens whenever any `stories.mdx` files don't render any stories - so only Docs needs to appear in the sidebar. I assume this handling can be removed when we finally remove Stories MDX completely.\r\n\r\n### 3. Minor improvements to the `server` renderer\r\n\r\n- The default `stories` glob when initing a `server` project now includes `yaml` and `yml` extensions along with the existing `json` extensions. The indexer already handled this, it just wasn't in the globs\r\n- The default stories for Page have now been converted to YAML to showcase/test this behavior\r\n- The new indexer adds support for tags, and autodocs works mostly\r\n\r\nTwo aspects of autodocs that are broken in the server renderer:\r\n\r\n- Any (iframed) stories beyond the first three always hangs forever in loading, consistently\r\n- Controls don't work, they don't trigger any changes\r\n\r\nAre these two points enough that I should remove it again, or is this better than nothing @shilman ?\r\n\r\n<!-- Briefly describe what your PR does -->\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n1. See Chromatic doesn't report any changes to stories (especially changing names, ids), as the new indexers should produce the same result.\r\n2. See especially the unattached story at `?path=/docs/addons-docs-stories-mdx-unattached--docs`. It should be a lonely `unattached` Docs entry with no stories, because it's `docsOnly`.\r\n3. For the server changes you have to create the sandbox manually, by checking out this repo and creating the `internal/server-webpack5` sandbox.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the steps to test your changes here. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Run a sandbox for template, e.g. `yarn task --task sandbox --start-from auto --template react-vite/default-ts`\r\n5. Open Storybook in your browser\r\n6.

Previously it used story props to populate Vue component slots, but this was changed to use argTypes in 6c806b6, after which all stories had all slots defined. This would cause such conditions as the example above to always be truthy.\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies the slot generation a bit to allow slots to be undefined rather than defaulting to an `() => undefined` function value.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n1. Run a sandbox for template, e.g. `yarn task --task sandbox --start-from auto --template vue3-vite/default-ts`\r\n2. Open Storybook in your browser\r\n3. Access the `Example/Button` story and verify that the icon wrapper `<span>` does not exist on the button stories with no `icon` slot value defined.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to make sure your PR is ready to be reviewed. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure your changes are tested (stories and/or unit, integration, or end-to-end tests)\r\n- [x] Make sure to add/update documentation regarding your changes\r\n- [x] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n#### Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

It supports different package managers and nested dependency resolutions, using a new `NestedDependencyResolution` type and the `overrides` field in `package.json`. It also introduces a new `scaffoldProject` function that prompts the user to choose a template from the `templates` module during init, which contains updated and consistent configurations for various frameworks. Additionally, it adds a `silent` option to the `sandbox` command, which suppresses the console output, and a `scaffolding-readme-template.md` file, which is used to generate a custom README.md file for the scaffolded projects. Finally, it simplifies the `project_types` module and removes some unused files.\r\n\r\n### Walkthrough\r\n<!--\r\ncopilot:walkthrough\r\n-->\r\n### <samp>\ud83e\udd16 Generated by Copilot at

The plan is to copy the file to `StoryIndexGenerator.test.ts` that will have the same tests but with the new API instead (plus a bunch more)\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR here will implement support for the new `IndexEntry` in `StoryIndexGenerator`, which should be enough to make this releasable.

Previously it would list prereleases as later than stable releases, which caused the change calculation to get more changes than actually true. It would think that `7.1.0-rc.2` was later than `7.1.0`, causing it to list the changes for `7.2.0-alpha.0` to go all the way back to `7.1.0-rc.2`, even though it only needed to go back to `7.1.0`.\r\n\r\nThe two Svelte vite changes listed in the changelog for `7.2.0-alpha.0` was actually already released in `7.1.0`, but the faulty change looking included them in `7.2.0-alpha.0` as well:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/23504/files#diff-c39e91bd3d7f02d36f0212bd4dc4958db10059da7ab8c79bbe546a12e8973cd6R4-R5\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso updated `next.json` manually as it was forgotten when updating `CHANGELOG.prerelease.md` manually in `7.2.0-alpha.0`. (which is okay, because [that documentation change isn't merged yet](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/23491))\r\n<!-- Briefly describe what your PR does -->\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the steps to test your changes here.

If your PR is related to an issue, provide the number(s) above; if it resolves multiple issues, be sure to break them up (e.g. \"closes #1000, closes #1001\"). -->\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nFixed a now-outdated statement in a README\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\n\r\n* NPM shows the latest version of this package as 7.x ; the readme said \"this\" version was 4.x, which is confusing. So we just take out \"This\".\r\n\r\nQuestions: \r\n* should this really go to 'next' branch as github template suggests?\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n- Go to NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/preset-create-react-app\r\n- Confirm that \"this\" latest version is no longer 4.x (you should see it as 7.x instead)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to make sure your PR is ready to be reviewed. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure your changes are tested (stories and/or unit, integration, or end-to-end tests)\r\n- [x] Make sure to add/update documentation regarding your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n#### Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.
