        "body": "The menu bar on the left and search always points to the latest docs, which is fine for now, but will need to be updated if we add multiple pages of documentation for another version.\r\n\r\nThe ideas is that the latest docs would be available at svelte.dev/docs while other versions would be available at svelte.dev/docs/3 or whatever. Right now this has the full documentation available at svelte.dev/docs and a single placeholder page at svelte.dev/docs/5\r\n\r\nI chose to go with a version under the docs URL as it's the main thing that needs to be versioned. The only other thing that needs to be versioned is the REPL, but it makes sense to do that separately as the docs just need a major version and the REPL needs a specific patch version and the REPL already have versioning built-in. Versioning really doesn't make sense for things like the blog posts.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, docs will be entirely powered by the `master` branch. What's on other branches will not affect the docs site. I doubt we'll be adding many new features to older versions, so it's pretty rare that people will be updating the code and docs on an old branch at the same time. We can delete the docs from non-master branches as well to prevent confusion. On the otherhand, I imagine it will be more common that you want to update the docs for multiple versions at one time. In that case it's easier to have the docs for multiple versions present in `master` so you don't have to send two PRs.",

However, hbirler, in the same thread, mentioned that this error in claims should not cause problems in the correctness of the output. Turns out the intended hydration was not working because an empty `claimed_nodes` array was being regarded as properly claimed nodes rather than a case of mismatch.\r\n\r\nI did not add a test as I was unable to recreate the bug outside of SvelteKit (attempts in `test/runtime` and `test/runtime-browser` led to passing tests with output different than when I run the Svelte component in SvelteKit). Will be happy to add one if some guidance is provided as to how to recreate this within the test structure ",

This file is currently in the language-tools repo and ships with svelte2tsx, but the problem is that TypeScript will load the `svelte/elements` version that comes with the svelte-language-server. Moving this to the Svelte core makes TypeScript always resolve it to the user-installed/workspace version of Svelte. Making it resolve to the user version also fixes the problem with the declaration merging of `declare module \"svelte/elements\"`. This allows the user/library to add custom types with it. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// app.d.ts\r\nimport { HTMLButtonAttributes } from 'svelte/elements'\r\n\r\ndeclare module 'svelte/elements' {\r\n    export interface SvelteHTMLElements {\r\n        'custom-button': HTMLButtonAttributes;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    export interface HTMLButtonAttributes {\r\n        'veryexperimentalattribute': string;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is meant to be loaded by ts or svelte-language-server. It's not meant to be user-facing. So this doesn't need to be in the package.json export and doesn't need documentation on its usage. @dummdidumm What do you think about the file naming and the declare module thing? ",

        "body": "fix #4265 \r\n\r\nThis is a long standing issue that's been reported multiple times, see #4430 #4447 #5555 #6590, the list goes on...It was once partially fixed in #7981 but then reverted in #8114.\r\n\r\n## Main idea of the fix\r\n\r\nThe thing that bugs ppl the most is *double firing update* when bind to non-primitive value at component init phase. This fix targets this scenario specifically.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script> // Parent.svelte\r\nimport Child from './Child.svelte';\r\nlet value = ['foo']\r\n$: console.log('parent value', value);\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<Child bind:value />\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script> // Child.svelte\r\nexport let value = ['zoo'] \r\n$: console.log('child value', value);\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<div>{JSON.stringify(value)}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm gonna use the term \"backflow\" to refer to the process of `child_value_binding() -> invalidate(parent_value)`. Backflow is necessary to sync child value back to parent. But it could be unnecessary in some cases. Because `safe_not_equal` conservatively invalidates non-primitive value, it's a failed guard. So this fix propose an extra flag `skip_binding` to guard against unnecessary backflow.\r\n\r\nNoted that first backflow happen at `flush -> binding_callbacks.pop()() -> bind -> child_value_binding`. By this time we've completed init phase, and every component is `ready`. \r\n\r\nNow focus on init phase and consider the following cases (\u2705 = necessary backflow,  \u274c = unnecessary backflow)\r\n\r\n1. \u2705 first to tick off the obvious, when Parent value is `undefined`, Child shall backflow to populate Parent value.\r\nBelow we discuss cases where Parent pass non-undefined down to Child.\r\n2. \u274c Child does not touch the value at all, then value is already at-sync after init, no backflow needed. \r\nThis is also THE MOST COMMON USE CASE which current PR seek to fix.\r\n3. \u2705 Child reactively (within `$:` statements) modifies the value, during `child.$$.update()` call, need backflow.\r\n4. \u2705 Child imperatively modifies the value at init phase, during `init -> instance` call, need backflow. \r\nThis case should be further broken down to 2 sub-cases:\r\n  4.1. Immutable modification, value's reference changed, e.g. `export let value; value = [\"default\"];`\r\n  4.2. Mutable modification, e.g. `export let value; value.foo = \"bar\";`\r\n\r\n<del>Proposed fix correctly handles backflow in all above cases EXCEPT sub-case 4.2.</del>\r\n\r\nProposed fix correctly handles backflow in all above cases.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nChanges made to three places:\r\n1. The `$$invalidate` runtime function, when `ready == false` sets `$$.bound[i] = true` in order to cater for case 3. This mark is essentially the same as `$$.dirty` which is not available before `ready`.\r\n2. The `bind` runtime function triggers the first backflow during `flush`, here I pass a `skip_binding` flag to `child_value_binding`. The flag is determined by `$$.bound[i]` dirty mark. This takes care of case 2 and 3.\r\n3. The generated `child_value_binding` function, I add `if (!#skip_binding || ${lhs} !== #value)` guard. It prevents the unnecessary backflow of case 2, also `${lhs} !== #value` check allows backflow for case 1 and 4.1. \r\n\r\nCase 4.2. needs backflow <del>but is unfortunately left out, because a) `$$invalidate` is not called, b) `${lhs} !== #value` fails to detect, we don't have the tool to distinguish this case.</del> and is now detected by inserting `$$invalidate` call on prop assignment at `instance` top level context.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

        "body": "Fixes https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8891\r\n\r\nWhen an outro starts, a bind:this variable is now nulled immediately, instead of when the element is destroyed. This is a breaking change. \r\n\r\nThis makes the behaviour consistent with, and appropriate for, the case where the bind:this value is swapping from one transitioning element to another (such as in an if/else block), and avoids the bug in that situation where the outroing component nulls the bind:this variable which has since been bound to another element. This bug specifically breaks snapshotting in SvelteKit when using transitions on pages.\r\n\r\nThe new `binding-this-transition-js-if-else-block` test highlights the bug most simply (in practice the bug is more subtle - since the unwanted nulling doesn't cause the element to be invalidated, it isn't usually until some other change occurs that the change in the value is reactively apparent).\r\n\r\nThings to do still (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n- Three existing transition tests, that relied on bind:this not being nulled for an outroing component, have been modified so that they succeed. They are less thorough as a result though, and so further changes may be appropriate to those tests. \r\n- It may also be suitable to add a test that proves that unmounting an element with a local transition, but such that the transition doesn't fire, also causes bind:this to be nulled appropriately (I am not sure if any existing tests would prove that.)\r\n- Also, in `bind_this.js`, the branch for when there are contextual_dependencies, would likely need similar changes if this approach is appropriate.\r\n\r\nBecause this pull request affects code that is possibly undergoing considerable change for Svelte 5, as well as it being a breaking change, it may be appropriate for this pull request to inform that process rather than be used directly.",

This feels like regular serverless, but these have no cold starts, smaller runtime and overall a little bit faster. It could have been regular edge function deployed globally, but not sure how that would affect performance for users far away from the supabase instance. Worth experimenting though~~\r\n\r\nEntire is prerendered, and REPL is edge functions. They aren't regional yet, as there's a chance that with new infra, for far away users, the REPL interfacing with supabase will stay mostly the same speed, and for those closer to the database instance should experience much higher boost, so its win win. its all speculation thought, but there's absolutely no risk in going with global edge\r\n\r\n## Everything fs async\r\n\r\nI found all the implementations of `fs.somethingSync` and replaced them with their promise based alternatives, bringing the build time of site down by a lot, and increasing prerender concurrency to 10. Pretty sure our vercel friends can handle this much parallel operations.\r\n\r\n## Reduced build times\r\n\r\nAs stated above, build times are down from average of 2:30 to 1:35, almost an entire minute lesser, all thanks to switching to edge adapter(generating which is must faster) and using the aforementioned everything-async approach\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

There was also an additional concern by dummdidumm prior to it being merged: https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8136#issuecomment-1508921417\r\n\r\n> If you return any from onMount, it's an error.\r\n\r\nThis updated type definition solves both of these concerns:\r\n\r\n- VS Code now shows the following onMount type signature:\r\n    ```ts\r\n    function onMount<T>(\r\n        fn: () => NotFunction<T> | Promise<NotFunction<T>> | (() => any)\r\n    ): void\r\n    ```\r\n    This is a lot more readable for humans compared to the previous one, since it's clearer what type we're trying to exclude.\r\n- Any async function that returns any is no longer a type error.\r\n\r\nThis does also mean that explicitly typecasting a `function` into `any` will be allowed, but as per Conduitry's comments on the matter https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8136#issuecomment-1508934533:\r\n\r\n> If someone really has a good/weird reason for going that, they can add a ts-ignore.\r\n\r\nIt's not a big problem to allow explicit opt-outs anyway.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have opted to *not* add a changelog entry, because the current breaking change entry pointing to #8136 is very much still adequate to cover the changes from this PR.

        "body": "This provides us with better type declarations and a smaller package. On the `version-4` branch, the `types` directory takes 300kb (or 1.1MB on disk, because it's 264 separate files). In this PR, it takes 23kb (25kb on disk) with two files.\r\n\r\nAll the types are put into a single bundle, and treeshaken (so we don't ship internal types that aren't referenced by public APIs). \r\n\r\nAs well as the size benefits, this provides a much better experience for Svelte users. This is what happens today:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/assets/1162160/c7c0538d-e137-47a0-a7af-2d99ac99c701\r\n\r\nNotice a few things:\r\n\r\n* VSCode auto-imports `svelte/internal.js`. `svelte` is available in the auto-import menu (it's confusing that they're both there), but you have to actively select it\r\n* Cmd-clicking on `onMount` takes you to the .d.ts file, rather than the implementation. (Even though the implementation isn't all that self-explanatory in the case of `onMount`, developers [overwhelmingly prefer this behaviour](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1660629715613368320).)\r\n* Typing `in:fade` doesn't trigger an auto-import for `svelte/transition` \u2014 VSCode simply can't find it. It _can_ find a horrendous list of internal junk like `fix_and_destroy_block` from `svelte/types/runtime/internal/each`\r\n* When you manually import it, it tries to autocomplete to `svelte/transition.js`, most likely because of my editor configuration. This will not resolve correctly\r\n* you can cmd-click on `fade` but, again, it takes you to the type declaration. This time, it _is_ useful to go straight to the implementation, to understand how you'd build your own custom transition\r\n\r\nWith this PR, things look very different:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/assets/1162160/f26bc414-8063-4b64-b125-90e567b7a373\r\n\r\nBecause it uses `declare module`, nothing relies on the app developer having the right TypeScript/editor configuration (`moduleResolution`, file extension preferences etc) to get the right imports, and there are no false positives \u2014 just the public API.",

        "body": "Fixes #4317 \r\n\r\nI did some digging and the infinite loop occurs when the array or iterable in the each-loop is a literal array, a (pure or impure, it depends) array from a regular function or generator function (iterable), containing objects or more arrays. The exact internal reasons on how the infinite loop came to be is ~confusing and hard to describe, even for me digging this \ud83d\ude01, so, uh, yeah...~\r\n\r\nHere's my attempt to explain what's going on with the bug. I'll use this https://svelte.dev/repl/c0a3494b41f14ebd84a5f2f3f9747fa1?version=3.59.1, courtesy of the original bug report, as an example.\r\n\r\nWhen the component is created and mounted, the binding functions are called (from the example, it is the `div_binding` functions), which add callbacks to the `binding_callbacks` list. After the component is mounted, the internal `flush()` function is called. The callbacks in `bindings_callbacks` are called, which invalidates the `working_array`. When it invalidates the `working_array`, it causes the component to update. When updating, we compare each array element with the previous array element, decide that they're different, which causes us to call the `div_binding` functions again, adding callbacks to the `binding_callbacks` list, again, and we're back to where we started, causing an infinite loop. (Thanks browser debugger!)\r\n\r\nTo get the infinite loop, at the stage where we compare the array elements, they are different. This could be caused by having a function returning an array of objects/arrays, or an impure function returning different things every time you call it, or a literal array of objects, or whatever. We comparing two objects (different in memory but same in what it contains), or two different values because the function is impure and we erroneously call the function that returns the array but the function is not invalidated. We don't need to do this, because we are not invalidating the actual array to be iterated, and requiring us to get the new array. Therefore, this PR adds a `dirty` check around arrays, or if the array is literal, no need to get a new literal array because we already defined it already. \r\n\r\nHope this comment is clear enough!\r\n\r\n# HEADS UP: BIG RESTRUCTURING UNDERWAY\r\n\r\nThe Svelte repo is currently in the process of heavy restructuring for Svelte 4. After that, work on Svelte 5 will likely change a lot on the compiler aswell. For that reason, please don't open PRs that are large in scope, touch more than a couple of files etc. In other words, bug fixes are fine, but feature PRs will likely not be merged.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

Therefore the ordering has changed in Svelte 4. Now, preprocessors are executed in order, and within one group the order is markup, script, style:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { preprocess } from 'svelte/compiler';\r\n\r\nconst { code } = await preprocess(source, [\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tname: 'first preprocessor',\r\n\t\tmarkup: () => {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs first');\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tscript: () => {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs second');\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tstyle: () => {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs third');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tname: 'second preprocessor',\r\n\t\tmarkup: () => {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs fourth');\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tscript: () => {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs fifth');\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tstyle: () => {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs sixth');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n], {\r\n\tfilename: 'App.svelte'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need to get back the old ordering, you can do something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { preprocess } from 'svelte/compiler';\r\n\r\nconst { code } = await preprocess(source, [\r\n  {\r\n    markup: preprocessor_one.markup\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    markup: preprocessor_two.markup\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    script: preprocessor_one.script\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    script: preprocessor_two.script\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    style: preprocessor_one.style\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    style: preprocessor_two.style\r\n  }\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's now also required to add a `name` for every preprocessor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, script and style preprocessors gain the capability to modify the attributes on their tag.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

        "body": "The ecosystem generally expects that dependencies are external. E.g. if there's a security issue, it will get flagged by `npm audit` if external. If it's bundled then we need to make sure we're raising a security vulnerability against Svelte which bundles a vulnerable version of a library and we're not doing that, which means that all security vulnerabilities in dependencies go unflagged.\r\n\r\nThis may result in more being downloaded on average. However, many of our dependencies like `magic-string`, `@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec`, etc. are already used by other projects like Rollup, `svelte-preprocess`, etc. For npm users, this will avoid the download cost if the dependency is already used by the project. For users using package managers like pnpm, this is an even bigger win as those dependencies won't need to be downloaded if they are used by any other project you've already installed.\r\n\r\nWe also avoid generating source maps for these packages when we avoid bundling, which will really shrink the size of the Svelte package. For packages like `periscopic` which distribute unbundled source, this is a big win as they don't need source maps at all. For packages which have sourcemaps of their own, we don't get that savings, but we could probably convert some of the libraries to this lighter-weight way of being distributed especially if they're ones we control.",
