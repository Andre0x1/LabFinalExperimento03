        "body": "A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\r\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\r\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\r\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\r\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\r\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\r\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\r\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\r\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\r\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\r\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\r\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\r\n\r\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\r\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\r\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\r\nthe various releases.\r\n\r\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\r\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\r\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\r\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\r\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\r\n\r\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\r\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\r\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\r\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\r\ndirection to make these releases possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

This will make the ground truth result very long, therefore cause this bug.\r\n\r\nBut the COCO metrics are ok, the reason is in `metrics/coco_evaluation.py -> CocoDetectionEvaluator -> add_eval_dict -> update_op` function, we cut the ground truth length, as shown below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n          self.add_single_ground_truth_image_info(\r\n              image_id, {\r\n                  'groundtruth_boxes': gt_box[:num_gt_box],\r\n                  'groundtruth_classes': gt_class[:num_gt_box],\r\n                  'groundtruth_is_crowd': gt_is_crowd[:num_gt_box],\r\n                  'groundtruth_labeled_classes': gt_labeled_classes\r\n              })\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, if we apply the same logic to pascal metrics, we can solve this issue.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\nI updated `utils/object_detection_evaluation.py -> ObjectDetectionEvaluator`:\r\n\r\n- Added a new variable named `_expected_gt_keys` which indicates which dict value we need to *cut*.\r\n- Updated the `ObjectDetectionEvaluator -> add_eval_dict -> update_op` function to cut GT values to real length.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nFor a new feature or function, please create an issue first to discuss it\r\nwith us before submitting a pull request.\r\n\r\nNote: Please delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nManually test:\r\n- Setup a new object detection project with `pascal_voc_detection_metrics` and `coco_detection_metrics` metrics settings in `eval-config`. (COCO for comparing here)\r\n- Train and eval with a demo SSD model\r\n- We can see very low pascal voc scores vs COCO's normal scores.\r\n- Apply this fix\r\n- We can see normal pascal voc scores compares with COCO's.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Contributor-License-Agreements).\r\n- [x] I have read [guidelines for pull request](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] My code follows the [coding guidelines](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Coding-guidelines).\r\n- [x] I have performed a self [code review](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Code-review) of my own code.\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings.\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n",

I had to switch this to use keras-subclassing which allows a clear separation between creating the layers and executing the model. I was careful to keep the same layers and ordering so that the keras H5 checkpoint still restores correctly.\r\n\r\n+ export.py\r\n  + Fixed the version check at the top.\r\n  + Added multiple signatures with `get_concrete_function`\r\n  + Added code to rebuild the model after testing (b/178785522)\r\n  + Added `signatures=yamnet.single` to `tf.saved_model.save` to be sure the correct signature is set for serving.\r\n  \r\n+ features.py\r\n  + All changes are to generically handle a variable number of outer dimensions. \r\n\r\n+ yamnet.py\r\n  + `YAMNetBase` implements `yamnet .yamnet` and includes code to fold/unfold the batch axis.\r\n  + `YAMNetFrames` implements `yamnet.yamnet_frames_model`.\r\n\r\n## Is this transformation to the implementation correct? [\u2705, Yes the npz tests cover this]\r\n\r\nIt looks like for a single clip, each frame is processed independently, so I can just fold the `batch` and `frames` axis together.\r\nThese were the shapes for an input `waveforms` of shape `(None,)`:\r\n\r\n \r\n ```\r\nwaveforms (None,)\r\nwaveform_padded (None,)\r\nlog_mel_spectrogram (None, 64)\r\nfeatures (None, 96, 64)\r\nnet (None, 96, 64, 1) # before reshape     shape: (frames, width, height, channels)\r\nnet (None, 96, 64, 1) # after reshape\r\n\r\n# ... run conv layers ...\r\n\r\nembeddings (None, 1024)\r\nlogits (None, 521)\r\npredictions (None, 521)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese were the shapes for an input `waveforms` of shape `(None,)`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nwaveforms (None, None)\r\nwaveform_padded (None, None)\r\nlog_mel_spectrogram (None, None, 64)\r\nfeatures (None, None, 96, 64)\r\nnet (None, None, 96, 64, 1) # before flatten      shape: (batch, frames, width, height, channels)\r\nnet (None, 96, 64, 1) # after flatten                    shape: (batchframes, width, height, channels)\r\n\r\n# ... run conv layers ...\r\n\r\nembeddings (None, 1024) # before fold            shape: (batchframes, embedding)\r\nembeddings (None, None, 1024) # after fold    shape: (batch, frames, embedding)\r\nlogits (None, None, 521)\r\npredictions (None, None, 521)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## TFJs [\u2705 FIXED]\r\n\r\n> Edit: Adding an `init_scope` fixed this. The broadcast in the implementation of linspace is what was causing this to fail. I did not change that part. So the mystery to me is why was that passing at head.   \r\n\r\nTFJS seems to be working at head. \r\nAnd seems broken by this change:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 240, in <module>\r\n    main(sys.argv[1:])\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 237, in main\r\n    make_tfjs_export(tflite_saved_model_dir, tfjs_export_dir)\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 221, in make_tfjs_export\r\n    tfjs_saved_model_converter.convert_tf_saved_model(\r\n  File \"/usr/local/google/home/markdaoust/venv3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflowjs/converters/tf_saved_model_conversion_v2.py\", line 644, in convert_tf_saved_model\r\n    optimize_graph(frozen_graph, signature,\r\n  File \"/usr/local/google/home/markdaoust/venv3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflowjs/converters/tf_saved_model_conversion_v2.py\", line 147, in optimize_graph\r\n    raise ValueError('Unsupported Ops in the model before optimization\\n' +\r\nValueError: Unsupported Ops in the model before optimization\r\nBroadcastArgs\r\n```",

This used to be possible but right now visualizations can only be exported via event files to TensorBoard. This new implementation of `visualization_export_dir` also does not accumulate all the images in memory like the TensorBoard export does, which makes it possible to export all the images in a data set.\r\n>\r\n> This code is applicable to TensorFlow 1 only.\r\n>  \r\n> This reuses the legacy visualization export code, but now that code is called from within the existing TensorBoard Summary metric's update function, where the TensorBoard images are accumulated, so it also takes advantage of the existing visualizations which the TensorBoard Summary visualization metric is already generating. I'm not sure if writing to disk (synchronously, I think) inside a py_func is bad practice, but this seemed the most low-impact way of adding back the functionality. There is a performance impact when the flag is enabled, but there should not be when the flag is off.\r\n>\r\n> As I've implemented it, when \"train and eval\" jobs are run, the repeated invocations of the eval phase can cause visualizations of the same images to overwrite those from the last phase. Because of this and because of the performance hit, it may be advisable to only use this setting in eval-only mode. I've added a comment to `eval.proto` to that effect.\r\n>\r\n> I've also updated the comment over the `keep_image_id_for_visualization_export` in the proto file to specify that it uses specifically `source_id`. It appears that the only id available was a `key` field that was a hash of the `source_id`, which wasn't very helpful, so I added a tweak to pass through the `source_id`, thinking that tying this config setting specifically to `source_id` makes sense since other id options like the input field `image/key/sha256` are not currently being passed through.\r\n>\r\n> Because I needed something that would export all images, this setting now doesn't abide by `eval_config.num_visualizations`. Setting `visualization_export_dir` will export *all* images that are evaluated. This is because the TensorBoard export that uses `num_visualizations` accumulates all the images in memory, making it infeasible for large amounts of images, at least on my machine.\r\n>\r\n> There are also a couple TODOs where I was unsure about the best way to do something.\r\n>\r\n> * Context: I am working on an analysis for my master's thesis that relies on categorizing a large number of detector false positives, for which I need a large number of visualizations. I attempted setting `num_visualizations` == number of images in data set, but it used more memory than my machine could handle.\r\n>\r\n> * New dependencies: none\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n> :memo: Please describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.\r\n> I have run eval-only and train-and-eval object detection jobs using model_main.py and TF1. My config was based on the [ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs/ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config) sample config, but with custom data that also contained the `source_id` field.\r\n>\r\n> 1. Automated: I've written a new unit test in `visualization_utils_test.py`\r\n> 2. Manual eval-only:\r\n>     a. Set `eval_config.visualization_export_dir`\r\n>     b. Run eval job with model_main.py\r\n>     c. The images should be created with names like \"export-1.png\" etc.\r\n> 3. Manual eval-only w/source-id:\r\n>     a. Set `eval_config.visualization_export_dir`\r\n>     b. In addition set `eval_config.keep_image_id_for_visualization_export` to `true`, as well as `eval_input_reader.include_source_id` to `true`.\r\n>     c. Run an eval job with model_main.py\r\n>     d. The images should be created with names like \"export-<source_id>-1.png\".\r\n> 4. Manual train_and_eval w/source-id\r\n>     a. Set `eval_config.visualization_export_dir`\r\n>     b. In addition set `eval_config.keep_image_id_for_visualization_export` to `true`, as well as `eval_input_reader.include_source_id` to `true`.\r\n>     c. Run train_and_eval job with model_main.py\r\n>     d. Wait for first eval phase to occur/finish.\r\n>     e. The images should be created with names like \"export-<source_id>-1.png\".\r\n>     f. Wait for 2nd eval phase to occur\r\n>     g. The image file timestamps indicate the 2nd phase overwrites images from the first phase.\r\n\r\n## Untested:\r\n> * Eager execution - tried briefly but was unable to turn on eager execution in TF1 running model_main.py\r\n> * TF2 (from what I can gather, my code is only called by model_main.py, so TF2 will not invoke it. But my fix only fixes the config settings for TF1)\r\n> * Batch size > 1 - I've only tested with eval_config.batch_size = 1.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Contributor-License-Agreements).\r\n- [X] I have read [guidelines for pull request](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [X] My code follows the [coding guidelines](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Coding-guidelines).\r\n- [X] I have performed a self [code review](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/wiki/Code-review) of my own code.\r\n- [X] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n- [X] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation.\r\n- [X] My changes generate no new warnings.\r\n- [X] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.\r\n\r\n",
