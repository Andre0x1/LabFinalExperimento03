        "body": "### Summary\r\nThis PR introduces several flags to the build script that allows users to bake ligatures directly into the font and thus enabling them permanently. This is useful for those who want to use certain style sets or character variations in editors that otherwise don't allow for such features.\r\n\r\n### How can it be used?\r\nFeatures to be baked in can be given to build.sh as a comma separated list with the `-f / --features` flag.\r\nAll features that were not already in their own files were pulled out of FiraCode.glyphs into individual files. There is no way I will write a parser for the glyphs file to do that at runtime. The build script will then read the code in these feature files and appends it to the `calt` property inside the glyphs file.\r\n\r\nTo more easily generate multiple font versions with different features baked in, there are flags `-n / --family-name` for build.sh that will allow users to set a custom family name for the font. The special value \"features\" will append the feature list to the font name. The family name is exported and used by the other build scripts as a directory to separate different font versions. The filenames were not changed, the directory name is enough separation.\r\n\r\nVia another flag, `-w / --weights`, a comma separated list of font weights to be generated can be given to build.sh. This was already possible by specifying font weights as separate arguments to build_ttf.sh but now they can be given to the overall automated build script as well.\r\n\r\nThe flag `-g / --generate-glyphs-only` will cause the script to exit after the custom glyphs file has been created without actually building the font. I personally use this to generate a glyphs file I can then use with [EzequielRamis/liga](https://github.com/EzequielRamis/liga) to patch other fonts with FiraCode's ligatures.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note for the future\r\n\r\nThis implementation relies on the code for all features being inside a file called `./features/{name}.fea` where `{name}` is the feature name, i.e. the code for the ss06 feature must be inside a file called *features/ss06.fea*. If that code contains lookups, those brackets must be on separate lines. Furthermore, the file must not contain inline comments (I don't know if these would be allowed in the first place). This is because all collected code blocks will be put on a single line.\r\n\r\n#### This is ok:\r\n```fea\r\nlookup backslash_thin {\r\n  ignore sub backslash.ss06 backslash';\r\n  sub backslash' by backslash.ss06;\r\n} backslash_thin;\r\n\r\n# This is fine as well\r\nlookup backslash_thin {\r\n  ignore sub backslash.ss06 backslash'; sub backslash' by backslash.ss06;\r\n} backslash_thin;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 1. These are all NOT ok:\r\n```fea\r\n# 1. This entire line will be ignored by grep\r\nlookup backslash_thin { ignore sub backslash.ss06 backslash';  sub backslash' by backslash.ss06; } backslash_thin;\r\n\r\n# 2. The first line will be ignored, the second line will be collected though, which breaks the resulting glyphs file with an unpaired }\r\nlookup backslash_thin { ignore sub backslash.ss06 backslash';  \r\nsub backslash' by backslash.ss06; } backslash_thin;\r\n\r\n# 3. This would end up commenting out all code below the inline comment\r\nlookup backslash_thin {\r\n  ignore sub backslash.ss06 backslash'; # Inline comment here,\r\n  sub backslash' by backslash.ss06;\r\n} backslash_thin;\r\n\r\n# 4. Semicolon on the wrong line will cause the line to be collected, see second bad example\r\nlookup backslash_thin {\r\n  ignore sub backslash.ss06 backslash';\r\n  sub backslash' by backslash.ss06\r\n#v \r\n ;} backslash_thin;\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCloses #1383\r\nCloses #1348\r\n\r\n### Related, close at your own discretion:\r\n| Issue | Reason |\r\n|-|-|\r\n| #1033 | Requested different style binaries |\r\n| #994 | Requested different style binaries |\r\n| #896 | Editor without support for style sets |\r\n| #869 | pyftfeatfreeze does not work [(see also here)](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer/issues/20)|\r\n| #842 | Editor without support for style sets<br>Requested different style binaries |\r\n",

        "body": "Hi @tonsky! I'm not sure whether you actually want to merge this entire PR, but I wanted to ask a few questions around merging some work I've done, and this seems like a logical place to do so.\r\n\r\n## Context:\r\nI've done work to make a PR to Google Fonts: https://github.com/google/fonts/pull/1911\r\n\r\nPart of this was making a variable font from Fira Code, and this required some edits to the GlyphsApp source. There were two main types of edits:\r\n1. Edits to metadata. I had to change some font info to ensure that exported metadata meets the OpenType spec & GF standards, as checked by [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)\r\n2. Edits to masters and outlines. FontMake (actually, varLib) can't extrapolate when it builds a variable font, so it requires masters that exactly match extreme instances. The Fira Code source had an extrapolated instance for Light, and an interpolated instance for Bold. So, I had to use GlyphsApp's \"Instance as Master\" feature to make exact masters from the Light and Bold instances, then export. As part of _this_, I was able to catch and fix some extrapolation and outline issues in the Light master (most were just a natural result of extrapolation): [here's a summary of my edits](https://github.com/thundernixon/FiraCode/blob/qa/googlefonts-qa/notes/outline-checks.md)\r\n\r\n## What's in this PR\r\n\r\nMy work here includes:\r\n- **An edited GlyphsApp source.** I think this should probably be merged, so the upgraded version can be the new source of truth, and so work isn't lost if you upgrade the font more in the future.\r\n- **The `googlefonts-qa` folder**, which includes some scripts and metadata files that are used to build fonts, then add new files to a local `google/fonts` repo to PR there. This is mostly helpful to the specific work of onboarding (or updating) the font to Google Fonts. I don't think it would hurt to merge this into `master` to make it obvious to future GF contractors, though we could instead have it in a branch for future use. If you do wish to keep it in a branch to keep `master` tidy, I can do a separate PR. However, we should probably try to find a way to make that obvious, because it's likely that the next time someone works on this for Google Fonts, it'll be someone other than myself.\r\n\r\nLet me know how you'd like me to proceed. Thanks!",
