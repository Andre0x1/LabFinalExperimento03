Its main purpose is to provide a space for developers to share, collaborate on, and improve upon code. The README.MD file is an important part of this process, as it serves as the primary source of information for users and contributors about a particular project.\r\n\r\n* Including political statements or content in the README.MD file of a project can be divisive and disruptive to the collaborative nature of the platform. It can also make users and contributors who disagree with the political statements or content uncomfortable or unwelcome. This can lead to a toxic environment that discourages participation and collaboration.\r\n\r\n* Furthermore, political statements or content in the README.MD file can also be seen as a form of advertising or promotion, which is not the intended purpose of the platform. This can lead to confusion among users and contributors, as they may not be aware of the political agenda or beliefs of the project.\r\n\r\n* In addition, one can argue that political statements or content in the README.MD file can also distract from the main purpose of the project, which is to provide information and instructions about the code. This can make it difficult for users and contributors to find the information they need to use or contribute to the project.\r\n\r\n* In light of these considerations, it is important to keep the README.MD file free of political statements or content in order to maintain a productive and inclusive environment for all users and contributors.",

        "body": "The previous implementation of merge sort used the array.shift() method to merge elements from leftArray and rightArray into the sorted array. This is a bad practice, because JavaScript's implementation of the Array.prototype.shift() method is, at worst, O(n) runtime complexity, where n is the length of the array being sorted (in order to move n elements of an array over by 1, all n elements of the array must typically be touched).\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I refactored merge sort to use array pointers instead. Now, after an element has been added to the sorted array, rather than delete it from the old array and shift the entire old array over, the array index pointer is just incremented to the right by one to avoid the old element. This will always require O(1) runtime complexity, which is a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\nI also added two simple concat() statements to the returned sortedArray value, because the length of the left and right arrays can no longer be used to determine if an element is still \"dangling\" (needing to be added to the sorted array).\r\n\r\nAll tests passed after my changes.\r\n\r\n[Quick Stack Overflow info on JavaScript array method runtime complexities](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22614237/javascript-runtime-complexity-of-array-functions)",

This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...
