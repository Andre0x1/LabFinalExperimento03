These schemes are well-suited for Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, and other distributions using terminals such as Gnome Terminal, Pantheon Terminal, Tilix, and XFCE4 Terminal. The inspiration for these color schemes stems from the design aesthetics of Elementary OS Luna. Notably, these schemes are also compatible with iTerm on macOS.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Added a concise yet informative description of the Gogh color scheme collection.\r\n- Mentioned its compatibility with different terminal applications and operating systems.\r\n- Emphasized the inspiration behind the color schemes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Confirmed accurate information.\r\n- [x] Followed the formatting guidelines.\r\n- [x] Verified that the provided URLs are active.\r\n\r\nPlease review and merge this pull request at your convenience.

It is a KDE tool but can be used everywhere meanwhile.\r\n- k9s: is a full kubernetes manager using just the terminal. It has a powerfgul UI, nice intuitive shortcuts and it makes you managing (monitor/edit/switch/...) your clusters very fast. Ofcasue it needs kubectl/az-cli/... as dependency for appling the usual commands. It simply gives them a nice UI and makes it super simple to use.\r\n- lazygit is a full GIT UI inside the terminal. It can be customized on themes, branch colors, .. and wraps up everything nicely. Your full git management it always accessable on your CLI sessions so you never need to leave the terminal again.
