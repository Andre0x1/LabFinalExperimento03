        "body": "Answering [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63923087/3001761) I found that by default, if a source file name is provided but no such file is found, an example file is generated. This is mentioned in the output:\r\n```\r\n  Loading test.json\r\n  Oops, test.json doesn't seem to exist\r\n  Creating test.json with some default data\r\n```\r\nbut is easy to miss. As the file is now created, there's no information that this happened on subsequent starts. This leaves an unwary user confused as to why their edits to the (wrong) JSON file don't seem to have any impact.\r\n\r\nTherefore I've introduced a `-g`/`--generate` flag. Without this CLI flag, if the file is missing, the server bails out. If you supply the flag, the old behaviour is restored.\r\n\r\nThis is strictly a **breaking change**; anyone who was relying on this to create the file will now have to explicitly supply the flag. However it seems unlikely too many people are purposefully relying on that feature, as the default canned data isn't terribly useful.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the specific implementation, I considered:\r\n\r\n- Defaulting to generating the missing source and using a flag to disable it, but doesn't solve the problem for the unwary user.\r\n- Passing all of `argv` to `load`, but adding the extra `generateFileIfMissing` parameter seemed less impactful in terms of encapsulation. I'm open to other suggestions on the name...\r\n- Explicitly warning if the flag was passed for a non-file source, but that didn't seem very high value.\r\n- Adding a suggestion (_\"To generate a file, supply the --generate flag\"_ or something) to the error message to ease the transition, but there didn't seem like a particularly neat way to do this.",

This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...

        "body": "My proposal is to expose a __config__ property together with the [db property](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/blob/master/src/cli/run.js#L74) on the express application created by json-server cli with the content of the configuration parsed by yargs, __useful in particular__ when using the `-c, --config` flag since yargs [will set all properties as arguments](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/api.md#configobject), this allow plugins to have their namespace of options in the config file without any other changes and it will open many customization possibilities to plugins and third party modules based on json-server.\r\n\r\nFor example take this [json-server plugin](https://github.com/jeremyben/json-server-auth) which right now expose [middlewares](https://github.com/jeremyben/json-server-auth/blob/master/src/index.ts) (to hook into json-server cli) with this update the user can define for example a __auth__ property in the configuration file:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"port\": 3001,\r\n  \"auth:  {\r\n    jwtExpiration: '1h',\r\n    // more plugin config\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this configuration can be later accessed, for example in the `/login` route exposed by the middleware, like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// pseudo code\r\nrouter.get('/login', (req, res) => {\r\n  const config = req.app.config.auth || defaultConfig\r\n  const token = jwt.sign(user, 'secret', {\r\n    exp: config.jwtExpiration\r\n  })\r\n  res.send(token)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will resolve many of the issues the plugin is facing right now, which depends basically on the possibility to pass custom configurations.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n- [x] Backward compatibility\r\n- [x] Extend plugins possibilities\r\n- [x] Enrich middleware use\r\n\r\nThe third point is about having [this](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#add-middlewares) middleware features to be capable of handling the basic needs otherwise implemented by the [modules](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#module) which requires the author of the plugin to depend on a (per package) version of json-server instead of simply hook up to the user choice version as middleware.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\nAny consequence? I'm open to feedbacks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy english is not very good and I've helped myself with g.translator, so if something is not clear about what I tried to explain, please tell me \ud83d\ude04 ",

Benefits:\r\n\r\n1. `shortid` is not maintained anymore (and issue tracker has many important issues). I tried to took maintenance, but found that I can\u2019t fix `shortid` with keeping API.\r\n2. `shortid` has problem with random generator ([issue](https://github.com/dylang/shortid/issues/70)) and ID uniformity ([issue](https://github.com/dylang/shortid/issues/85)). `nanoid` use hardware random generator and has special uniformity tests ([docs](https://github.com/ai/nanoid#security)).\r\n3. `shortid` has the problem with `-` symbol in the end of URL on some Android app ([issue](https://github.com/dylang/shortid/issues/96)). `nanoid` uses safe `~` instead of `-`. If it is not relevant to this project, I can replace `~` \u2192 `-` back to keep 100% old API.\r\n4. `nanoid` is [10x times faster](https://github.com/ai/nanoid#benchmark) than `shortid`.\r\n\r\n@ typicode what do you think?",

The old module which was available by the name [node-uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-uuid) got deprecated and will show error message upon every install of the module.\n\nTo get rid of those install errors I've created this **automated pull request**. I've run some checks against your code base to test whether you're using one of the [deprecated apis](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid/commit/5ae7287fc935eb55ef39133e4be17ef623ca000e), but this isn't the case.\n\n\nPlease test the changes against your code. I didn't run any tests and therefore can't guarantee that it isn't breaking. You can also just close this pr if you don't want to update your module.\n\nIn case there's already another pr open to upgrade uuid, I'm sorry for the effort I'm causing.",

Redis also uses same concept for near search. \n\nQuery syntax:\n\n```\nGET /cities?near=lat,lon&distance=meters\n```\n\nThere is no index created in json-server at run time for near search query. \nOn latitude and longitude property of data geohash is calculated and stored along data. The geohash is used for nearby search. I have used [node-geohash](https://github.com/sunng87/node-geohash) and [geo-nearby](https://github.com/strikeentco/geo-nearby) modules to achieve the same.\n\nSample output\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"city\": \"Jeogiwe\",\n  \"lat\": -28.12785,\n  \"lon\": -145.96895,\n  \"geohash\": 344516337195371\n}\n```\n\nTo generate the sample random location data use following script\n\n``` javascript\nvar dream = require('dreamjs')\nvar hash = require('ngeohash')\nvar jsonfile = require('jsonfile')\ndream.customType('incrementalId', function(helper){\n      return helper.previousItem ? helper.previousItem.id+1 : 1;\n})\nvar data = dream\n.schema({\n  id: 'incrementalId',\n  city: 'city',\n  lat: 'latitude',\n  lon: 'longitude'\n})\n.generateRnd(10000)\n.output()\n\ndata.forEach(function(city) {\n  city.geohash = hash.encode_int(city.lat, city.lon);\n})\njsonfile.writeFileSync('random-locations.json', {cities: data}, {spaces: 2});\n```\n\nOne doubt from my side, I have added default latitude, longitude and geohash property name in `src/server/router/index.js` but there should be a better place to add default and overwrite these properties while creating an instance of `json-server` when used as module. At command line i have added option to override the default property.\n",

To not conflict with loading nested lists, because of three parameter, I had to handle the nested after the plurals in router/index.js\n2. I had problems with the tests. I don't know what they the two problems are, I was still able to load nested objects.\n3. The test that is loading the database from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/db was very fragile at my location. I am in Shanghai/China so it often fails to download. To push to git, I needed 4 times to let this test pass.\n\np.s. I really love the simplicity of the JSON-Server. Recently I was at a conference, there was a talk about the sails.js API. and there also an support for both, http-RequestsTypes and specifying updates with a GET Request.\n\nI have more planes to develop for the JSON-Server.

This in turn causes an error when I access the json-server (which is hosted on localhost on port \"b\") which is:  \"A wildcard '*' cannot be used in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header when the credentials flag is true\". \n\nThis can be corrected by sending in an options object to the cors module, specifying a specific origin, and the flag credentials: true (i.e.: {\"origin\":\"http://localhost:63342\",\"credentials\":true}).\n\nIn order to accomplish this, I changed the way the express \"server\" is setup and exported and in turn changed the cli.js to receive the argument via command line argument and in turn pass it to the server. \n\nI am relatively new to node (and javascript development in general), so if this alteration is complete nonsense, please let me know.\n",
