Latter is being rendered as a page (since it have correct layout), which eventually falls back to the default metadata instead.\r\n\r\nPR trickles down the metadata when extracting page (creating a new component with `page`) to consolidates those.\r\n\r\nAlso PR expands Metadata to have base_page property to capture where it has been originally exists, as we clone down metadata then do `fillMetadataSegment` against the current page where LoaderTree is being created it creates a wrong relative path. For example, currently\r\n\r\n```\r\n/icon.svg\r\n - opengragph/\r\n      - static -> path being `/opengraph/.../icon.svg` instead of `/icon.svg`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen recursively traverse directory tree, capture each components with corresponding base_page to calculate instead.\r\n\r\nLastly, include global_metadata's favicon to be written in the metadata for the child components as well.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this doesn't make pass all of the metadata tests; there are lot to dig more.

We would correctly remove `foo.js` but not files imported by `foo.js`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds more files to be removed + fixes some misc files being imported as well.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Would appreciate a pointer to existing tests for the tracer or any advice on testing this.\r\n\r\nI followed the doc here https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/developing-using-local-app.md and was able to confirm the header values are being used to create the context through logging, but have not been able to do a more thorough test end-to-end to confirm that the generated API route spans are parented correctly. I wanted to deploy a testing app to Vercel that uses my local Next.js build so I could double check that the headers are being used in the generated traces, but I ran into some problems getting the app to build correctly with my local version of Next.js. I asked in Discord here https://discord.com/channels/752553802359505017/1007476603422527558/threads/1162417878507737228 and someone has been helping out but I still haven't yet been able to deploy it.

The paths being described here are file names but not folders, and end in a file extension.  This could confuse readers and developers, especially those new to Next.js, leading to potential misunderstandings and misconfigurations.  Perhaps folderName was a relic of a different example wrapping a folder name to do a nested path or other configuration?

This allows enter and exit transitions like `framer-motion` provides: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/30581915/c6db6647-c3ea-4673-bbc6-cdff7cd1bb7c\r\n\r\nSee `examples/with-framer-motion-app-dir` in this branch for the app code for the above.\r\n\r\nEDIT: AnimatePresence does seem to break in this case when route transitions happen too quickly, i.e. you navigate elsewhere while a route is still transitioning out. In this case, nothing shows up (with \"wait\" mode) or both routes render together (with \"sync\" mode). I'm not sure why, haven't dug into the interaction between Next' router and `FramerMotion` yet. Waiting for exit to navigate does work consistently, at least.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nRoute exit transitions are long overdue for Next.js 13's `appDir`. I think I speak for a lot of web designers and developers when I say this is a major factor preventing migration from `pages/` to `app/`.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/49596\r\n",

        "body": "This change is to pick the esm assets for RSC server layer and server rendering side, this is for production and development perf purpose, also to let them apply with the ESM related optimization such as tree-shaking, barrel files optimizations, etc.\r\n\r\nWe found a few packages that can't be optimized easily in bundling because we're using \"main\" field so the packages are not able to be tree-shaked, ending up with large bundle in the dist. This will change a lot for the bundling improvements as some packages are only having \"main\" and \"module\" field. So switching from CJS to ESM means better bundling, more optimization, and faster code.\r\n\r\n#56501 was a precondition for this, as previously the bundling strategy was applied to some library but triggered the invalid hooks erroring.\r\n\r\n### Other Monior Change\r\nPreviously we'll prefer to resolve CJS as there're 2 versions of react, using CJS assets will help let them pass by require-hook to use canary react for app router bundling assets. But now we changed the approach to bundling nextjs runtime and react packages. Now we dropped the condition that prefered to resolve CJS exports for externals, since if you're putting them in `serverComponentsExternalPackages`, they're not using the built-in react, so could potentially having trouble if any dependency is using react but excluded in bundles. So far we didn't see any report to this.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-1286\r\n",

This PR changes turbopack's behavior to closely mimic what current next.js's webpack plugin does, by\r\n\r\n1. Traverse the module graph, find out `dynamic(import())`\r\n2. Generate chunks for those imports, creates a partial LoadableManifest per each imports\r\n3. Merge partial manifest into a single `react-loadable-manifest.json`\r\n4. For the id, use static (Webpack mode) instead of dynamic so we can embed it in `react-loadable-manifest` as well as next.js can use it to pass it between server-client context.\r\n\r\nI left a small comment to the implementation (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/56389/files#diff-bf12ed2c69d0bc89a06884779da4ae44967eb8becada031dea12bedef28e2622R155) for the lifecycle of this feature in case to fix further.\r\n\r\nThis makes to pass most of the basic next-dynamic related integration tests, except if the import have webpack specific features like https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/ad42b610c25b72561ad367b82b1c7383fd2a5dd2/test/development/basic/next-dynamic/pages/dynamic/multiple-modules.js#L5.",

        "body": "The PR supersedes the https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/53150, which is way too outdated, has way too many conflicts, and also heavily relies on GitHub Copilot (which makes the progress slow and tedious).\r\n\r\nThe PR uses [`json-schema-to-zod`](https://github.com/StefanTerdell/json-schema-to-zod) (instead of the GitHub Copilot) to generate the zod schema, and manually replaces all generated `z.customRefine` with my hand-written zod schema.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Convert schema\r\n- [x] Reduce `z.any()` usage\r\n- [x] Create human-readable errors from the `ZodError`\r\n- [x] Update test cases to reflect the latest error message\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe benefit of using zod over ajv:\r\n\r\n- Easier maintenance: zod schema is straightforward to compose.\r\n- Better typescript support: config schema now strictly reflects the `NextConfig` type.\r\n- Smaller installation size: by replacing `ajv` and `@segment/ajv-human-errors` w/ `zod`, I am able to reduce installation size by 114 KiB.\r\n- Better Extension: the zod error message is easy to customize.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the previous PR https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/56083, @feedthejim replaces `zod` w/ `superstruct`. `superstruct` is lightweight and fast, which makes it perfect for creating simple schemas for RSC payload. But, this also means `superstruct` has its limitations compared to `zod`:\r\n\r\n- `superstruct`'s syntax is different, and some utilities's usage is counter-intuitive:\r\n  - `z.array(z.string()).gt(1)` vs `s.size(s.array(s.string()), 1)`\r\n  - `z.numer().gt(1)` vs `s.size(s.number(), 1)`, `s.min(s.number(), 1)`\r\n  - `z.boolean().optional().nullable()` vs `s.nullable(s.optional(z.boolean()))`\r\n- `superstruct` has weaker TypeScript support and worse DX compared to `zod` when composing huge schema:\r\n  - `zod.ZodType + z.object()` can provide a more detailed type mismatch message on which specific property is the culprit, while `Describe + s.object()` provides almost no information at all.\r\n- `zod`'s schema is more powerful\r\n  - `z.function()` supports `z.args()` and `z.returns()`, while `superstruct` only has `s.func()`\r\n  - zod also has Promise type `z.promise()` and intersection type `z.and()`\r\n- `superstruct`'s error is harder to parse compared to `zod`'s `ZodError` \r\n\r\nSo in the PR, I re-introduced `zod` for `next.config.js` validation.",

This PR would fix issue #56235. See also:  https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/nice-panini-2z3mcp .\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior**\r\nAt the moment, when an unexpected error occurs during app server rendering, a 200 ok is returned as status code. This seems to be undesirable because of the success status CDNs will cache the error pages and crawlers will index the page considering the error content as the actual content.\r\n\r\n**Desired Behavior**\r\nThis issue is related to discussion https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/53225. Even though I understand that the response status code cannot be set if streaming has started, in my view it would be best to set the response status to 500 whenever it can (so before the streaming has started) for SEO and (CDN) http caching.  This would also be consistent with how 404s currently work; that is, response status code is set to 404 if `NotFoundError` occurred before streaming (related [issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/43831) & [PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/55542)).\r\n\r\nIdeally, when a runtime error happens after streaming, a `<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\" />` would also be added. But I didn't want to make the PR too complex before receiving feedback.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",

While there are some options to work around this, it severely limits the number of nginx proxy_pass configurations that can be used.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThe previous match logic would look at both the curItemPath (which is expected to be URI encoded) and the \u00a0curDecodedItemPath (which is a decoded version of the curItemPath). In the scenario where the curItemPath is already decoded (or at least the slug delimiters are) this fails.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n       // check decoded variant as well\r\n        if (!items.has(curItemPath) && !opts.dev) {\r\n          curItemPath = curDecodedItemPath\r\n        }\r\n        const matchedItem = items.has(curItemPath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe case where many users encountered this is when the outside proxy decoded the url, then the url contains nextjs file convention character such as dynamic path delimiters (`[` and `]`) will fail as 404. Here as we the `currItemPath` is treated as encoded but could be the un-encoded one, so we encode the url path again and look it up. This way could prevent the script loading failures. This way we suppprts both encode and deoced url paths.",

With `.bind`, we can handle that in the future.\r\n- This is better than event callbacks `onSubmit={(e) => { await updateUser(userId, e.target.formData) }}` as this supports progressive enhancement.\r\n- This is better than re-creating a new action `action={async (formData) => { \"use server\"; return updateUser(userId, formData) }}` as inlined `\"use server\"` only works in Server Components.\r\n\r\n",

These errors may be thrown in the client-side too, so these functions work normally in client components, and are documented to work there. However, many users use them like this\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n\"use client\";\r\n\r\nimport { redirect } from \"next/navigation\";\r\n\r\nfunction ClientComponent() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <button onClick={() => redirect(\"/\")}>\r\n      Click me\r\n    </button>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere, since the error is not caught by the error boundary, no redirection actually happens.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some clarifications for that and gives advice to users who want to redirect on click: they should use `router.push` instead.\r\n\r\nRelated: #56027",

With node-file-trace it's extremely more efficient to trace in a single `nodeFileTrace` run so that all resolving/analysis etc can be efficiently cached. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, this reduces the amount of chunks we need to trace by waiting until post build since automatically statically optimized paths don't need to be traced as they are rendered to purely HTML and never re-rendered. \r\n\r\nThis reduces builds times by upwards of 4 - 5 minutes on larger projects.

Running the example with `run dev` will produce EvalError errors in console which prevent the app from functioning. This error also prevents any `<Script>` components with `afterInteractive` from being loaded. These issues do not occur in production where `eval` is not used.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Fixes the issue by allowing `unsafe-eval` if the environment is not `production`.\r\n- Improves the `script-src` value by [allowing backwards compatibility with browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#strict-dynamic) that do not support `strict-dynamic` (`https: http: 'unsafe-inline'` will be ignored by browsers that support `strict-dynamic`).\r\n\r\nSome further details are available here: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/55638.
