See:\r\n- https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/commit/aea1b79765f0f6d688e64b7698d5ff62862002d1\r\n- https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/pull/89\r\n\r\nThis PR specifies Prettier as an `optionalDependency` of `@vue/compiler-sfc`. With specified dependency, it will use `prettier@2` even if a project has `prettier@3`.\r\n\r\nP.S. I used the same versions as it was in the `component-compiler-utils`. It seems it has the same code.\r\n\r\n**Alternative solution:** make `@vue/compiler-sfc` compatible with both `Prettier@\"1 || 2\"` and `Prettier@3`. The problem is that it will make the compile function async.",

In Overload 3 of `defineComponent`, `props` is always defined so there's no need to check if `props` is defined or not by using `HasDefined` type, then we inlined `ExtractPropTypes<PropsOptions>` (the default type of the removed `Props` generic).",

        "body": "This PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by case.",

Although setting new properties on objects/classes which aren't previously defined in Typescript can be an anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n### [Playground link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/CYUwxgNghgTiAEBzCB7ARlC8DeBYAUPPJFAM6nwBqArgnoUfKQC5TMCWYTIzAPACoA+ABToAVuGYAueOMkAaeAGsQATxksY7AHaJ4AH3jbqAWzQgYigG6ZaM-gEp7AbgKMmrDl20gA7gGUeXgB5NDFFAGk1eBAAD2YQbWAKFVUUADN4UPCqTBj4xOSssIBtKNUAXRE5MGlinNSZcutbEBlKTCdciFcGAF8CAfwCMBRtFngTVWz4AF4cNyNTGQBWeUXNGQAiTR1ELfWGHxYQYBl6dwAHGBRLi2Z1BYZ3B7vVxaIhz8GCAgB6P7wAAiKBAFG0KGY8GYAAsbr4CDQQAA6Ug8YRTbKKLbGEwHeBbDDALYOXpI1HozFhbFEgAKN0u+MJUGJpMRtApzAx0zCyOOCWAyOut3uqmxrxATKJJN6v3wAPg-DhKF8pHZKJ8AUpPJyONMUpZMvVfL8gS5VN1dIZBtZZI5mrN3OyJpOguFdxgD3FqjuNqNwwDcUuKE9OD6QA)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n> This PR adds better type inference for Vue.set(object...) pattern, this might cause issues for existing consumers which have invalid usage of Vue.set.

This happens because those tags are considered components by the `maybeComponent()` function, so after applying these changes their children will be considered the contents of its default slot. As native HTML tags doesn't have slots, they won't be rendered. This is explained in more detail in the attached video.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation in this case is to write the standard HTML tags always in lowercase (in fact, in Vue 3 a \"failed to resolve component\" warning is displayed when an uppercase tag is used, even when it's still rendered).\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889025/149219636-254a6ebf-7f56-4d76-9de6-d8eed439a1e0.mp4\r\n\r\n*P.S.: I just realized I didn't show the fixed version working as expected in the video (I forgot to modify the input during the demo).

This approach is taken to prevent files in the zip overriding object methods that would exist on a normal object.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.6.0 2021-02-09</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: redirect main to dist on browsers (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/742\">#742</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix duplicate require DataLengthProbe, utils (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/734\">#734</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix small error in read_zip.md (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/703\">#703</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.5.0 2020-05-31</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix 'End of data reached' error when file extra field is invalid (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/544\">#544</a>).</li>\n<li>Typescript definitions: Add null to return types of functions that may return null (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/669\">#669</a>).</li>\n<li>Typescript definitions: Correct nodeStream's type (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/682\">#682</a>)</li>\n<li>Typescript definitions: Add string output type (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/666\">#666</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.4.0 2020-04-19</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add Typescript type definitions (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/601\">#601</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.3.0 2020-04-1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change browser module resolution to support Angular packager (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/614\">#614</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>v3.2.2 2019-07-04</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No public changes, but a number of testing dependencies have been updated.</li>\n<li>Tested browsers are now: Internet Explorer 11, Chrome (most recent) and Firefox (most recent).

Because `__filename` is `undefined`, `require(\"url\").pathToFileURL(__filename)` breaks. Notice this is with both `optimization.splitChunks` and `optimization.runtimeChunk` set to `false`, and there are no chunks -- proven by the `installedChunks` object below.\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  /******/ \t/* webpack/runtime/require chunk loading */\r\n  /******/ \t(() => {\r\n  /******/ \t\t__webpack_require__.b = require(\"url\").pathToFileURL(__filename);\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t// object to store loaded chunks\r\n  /******/ \t\t// \"1\" means \"loaded\", otherwise not loaded yet\r\n  /******/ \t\tvar installedChunks = {\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\"main\": 1\r\n  /******/ \t\t};\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t// no on chunks loaded\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\tvar installChunk = (chunk) => {\r\n  /******/ \t\t\tvar moreModules = chunk.modules, chunkIds = chunk.ids, runtime = chunk.runtime;\r\n  /******/ \t\t\tfor(var moduleId in moreModules) {\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\tif(__webpack_require__.o(moreModules, moduleId)) {\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\t\t__webpack_require__.m[moduleId] = moreModules[moduleId];\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\t}\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t}\r\n  /******/ \t\t\tif(runtime) runtime(__webpack_require__);\r\n  /******/ \t\t\tfor(var i = 0; i < chunkIds.length; i++)\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\tinstalledChunks[chunkIds[i]] = 1;\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t};\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t// require() chunk loading for javascript\r\n  /******/ \t\t__webpack_require__.f.require = (chunkId, promises) => {\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t// \"1\" is the signal for \"already loaded\"\r\n  /******/ \t\t\tif(!installedChunks[chunkId]) {\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\tif(true) { // all chunks have JS\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\t\tinstallChunk(require(\"./\" + __webpack_require__.u(chunkId)));\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t\t} else installedChunks[chunkId] = 1;\r\n  /******/ \t\t\t}\r\n  /******/ \t\t};\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t// no external install chunk\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t// no HMR\r\n  /******/ \t\t\r\n  /******/ \t\t// no HMR manifest\r\n  /******/ \t})();\r\n  /******/ \t\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The error message:\r\n   ```\r\n   TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The \"path\" argument must be of type string.
