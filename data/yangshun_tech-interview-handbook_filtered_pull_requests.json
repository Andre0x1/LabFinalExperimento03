The changes provide valuable advice on a topic that has not been mentioned in the TIH and it's very relevant in the hiring process. \r\n\r\nThis is the structure of the new sections added:\r\n\r\n1. Crafting the Perfect Cover Letter\r\n2. Common Pitfalls to Avoid on your Cover Letter\r\n3. Practical Tips\r\n4. Cover Letter Example and Evaluation\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testing Steps:\r\n\r\nTested the changes locally using `yarn dev:website`. Everything looks fine. Screenshot attached of the `live` version and my `localhost:3000` \ud83d\udc47 \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/assets/56862470/8131969e-39aa-4939-9403-0950331172d2)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional Information:\r\nAs we're reviewing content and not code, I'm providing a link to a Google Docs. Feel free to make any comments/suggestions/edits in the document and I'll propagate the changes to the `resume.md` and re-raise the PR.\r\n\r\n[[Link to Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q2-28b1crl_OOQctBwH09TNbLngjKKnCyDEBcRj-j7g/edit#heading=h.y6i2tg9koect)]\r\n\r\n_Signed-off-by: [Francisco Vigo] <[fjv222@gmail.com]>_\r\n",
